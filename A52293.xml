            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>TO HIS Moſt Excellent Majeſty <hi>WILLIAM</hi> III. By the Grace of GOD King of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>May it pleaſe Your Majeſty,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>FOR ſome part of that time, which you have been expoſing Your Sacred Perſon and afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an unwearied Application for the Good of Chriſtendom and the Advantage of the Reformed Religion, which admirable Endeavours God of his Infinite Mercy has been Pleaſed to Crown with a ſuitable Succeſs; I have had the leiſure, under Your Majeſty's Moſt Gracious Government and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, to the utmoſt of my poor Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities to defend the Cauſe of our Bleſſed Saviour and his Holy Religion; againſt
<pb facs="tcp:42179:3"/>
the Blaſphemous Exceptions, which A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſtical Men do raiſe againſt it.</p>
            <p>And now, through the Bleſſing of God, having Finiſhed this Mean Work, I humble beg leave to lay my Papers at Your Majeſty's Feet, imploring Your Royal Acceptance and Patronage of Them; which may be a Means to recommend them to ſome, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Thrown off all reſpect to our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, yet their Worldly Intereſt may oblige them to retain ſome for Your Majeſty; and perhaps the very name of ſo Good and ſo Great a Prince, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixt to this Book, may occaſion them to light upon ſomething therein, which may give them better Thoughts of that Holy Religion, which, Your Majeſty does ſo much reverence and they moſt unworthily deſpiſe. I am not ſo vain to imagine that my poor Endeavours ſhould ever prove in a like meaſure ſucceſsful with Your Majeſty's Arms and Conduct; yet by the Bleſſing of God, I hope, ſince Your Majeſty has ſo Publickly diſcountenanced Atheiſm and Prophaneneſs, I have a fairer Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of gaining ſome Advantage over the Enemies of Religion, than in any
<pb facs="tcp:42179:3"/>
other Reign, which it has been my Lot to live under.</p>
            <p>Dread Sir! may the Good God, who has hitherto proſpered Your Great Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings continue to incline Your Heart, zealouſly to oppoſe that ſpreading In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity, which unleſs a ſtop be put to it, will be the Ruin of theſe Kingdoms, and force Heaven to pour out the laſt Vials of its Wrath upon us. Now You have happily procured us Peace A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad and our Liberties at Home, may You go on in a no leſs Glorious Deſign, to Maintain the Cauſe of our Deſpiſed Redeemer, treading in the ſteps of Your great Predeceſſor <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> who when he had ſetled the Peace of the Empire and eſtabliſhed his Throne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Oppoſers, ſet himſelf next to the Noble Work of promoting Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, and to make the Croſs of Chriſt Triumph over the Blaſpheming In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels.</p>
            <p>God be Thanked, Unbelievers are not ſo Numerous now as then, but they are not inferior in their Wickedneſs and their ſpight to Religion, which if Your Majeſty by Your Power and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
<pb facs="tcp:42179:4"/>
can under the Bleſſing of God, happily ſuppreſs and reclaim; this will be a new Acceſſion to Your Glories, and will add freſh Laurels to Your Brow; This will render You yet dearer to God and to all good Men of every Perſuaſion among us, and will recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile the Affections of Your keeneſt E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies.</p>
            <p>Now that Your Majeſty may be as Succeſsful in this as in Your other Great Endeavours, that You may enjoy a long and happy Reign in this World, and an Eternal Kingdom in the next, is the Daily Prayer of,</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>HAving oftentimes with Grief conſidered the mighty Progreſs, which Atheiſm and Infidelity have made in this Age; I thought it was highly neceſſary that thoſe who by their Profeſſion had made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Teachers and Defenders of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Faith, ought not to ſpend their whole time in inforcing the Morality of its Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, and in confuting Innovations made in its Doctrine and Government; but were obliged ſometimes to afford their Aid towards the overthrowing thoſe Principles which tend to the total ſubverſion of our common Chriſtianity. Socinians, Papiſts, and Schiſmaticks, it is true, are guilty of very grievous and dangerous Errours, but
<pb facs="tcp:42179:5"/>
yet the worſt of them maintain ſome part of the Ground-work of Chriſtianity ſtill; but <hi>Atheiſts</hi> who deny a God, and <hi>Theiſts</hi> who diſown a Revelation, make our whole Religion an Impoſture, and all that have to do with it either Cheats or Fools. So that we that are Ministers of the Goſpel, are highly concerned to uſe the utmoſt of our force, againſt theſe Opinions, which debauch and damn ſo many Men, whoſe Souls we have the charge of, which tend to the diſcredit and total overthrow of our Profeſſion, and expoſe our Perſons to all the fooliſh ſcoffs of idle Men. Nay farther, there is the greateſt danger from theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidel Doctrines, becauſe they are eſpouſed by Men of all Parties, and by many of thoſe who join themſelves with ſome particular Body of Chriſtians; for it is eaſy to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, a great many men railing bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly againſt Papiſts or Phanaticks, when they believe no more of Jeſus Chriſt, than they do of Tranſubſtantiation; and have no more liking to the Goſpel, than to a long Canting Sermon. Now becauſe ſuch In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels lie herded among divers Sects of Chriſtians, as they are not ſo eaſily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, ſo they are not ſo vigorouſly oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; and by this means they have of late gained ſuch ſtrength, that now they
<pb facs="tcp:42179:5"/>
begin to look formidable. It is dreadful to think what numbers of Men are poiſoned by Infidel Principles; for <hi>Atheiſm</hi> and <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm</hi> are now got from the Court to the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change,</hi> they begin to talk them in Shops and Stalls, and the Cavils of <hi>Spinoſa</hi> and <hi>Hobbs</hi> are grown common, even to the very Rabble. But the greateſt encouragement which Infidelity meets with, is from ſome Philoſophical Gentlemen, who find that the Scripture ſeems to contradict ſome No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in Philoſophy, which they have eſpouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or ſome Experiments which they are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded of the Truth of; and therefore for that reaſon, they will disbelieve that and all Revealed Religion. Now ſome of theſe Gentlemen, being Men of Parts and Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and able to manage an Argument, they generally ſet upon ſome unlearned Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian; they puzzle and confound him with Philoſophick Terms and Experiments, and with a Set of Jeſts and Bantering Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions againſt Scripture; and when thus they have beat the poor Man out of his Road, they think they have for ever tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphed over Chriſtianity.</p>
            <q>
               <l>—Pudet haec opprobria nobis</l>
               <l>Et dici potuiſſe, &amp; non potuiſſe refelli.</l>
            </q>
            <p>Theſe Conſiderations have put me upon Writing this Dialogue, and have encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
<pb facs="tcp:42179:6"/>
me to conſider the chief of their Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which they are wont to make uſe of in their Diſcourſe, or which have been pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed of late in Theiſtical Writings: to the end that well-meaning and religious Men, whoſe Leiſure or Education will not let them ſearch ſo narrowly into theſe Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputes, may from this Treatiſe be furniſhed with ſufficient Anſwers to ſuch Infidel Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments. Now the Objections which are urged in this Dialogue, are part of them taken from the Diſcourſe of ſome Deiſts I have caſually converſed with; but are moſtly taken out of a Book lately pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, called <hi>Oracles of Reaſon,</hi> the firſt Book I ever ſaw which did openly avow In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity. This I had ſome thoughts once to have wrote a ſet Anſwer to, but I found it was ſo ſillily and looſely wrote, that upon more ſerious conſideration I could not think it did deſerve one. As to that Book, it is a Collection made up of a few Letters wrote between ſome Sparks at <hi>London,</hi> and of ſome Tranſlations made out of one or two Greek and Latin Books. All that is conſiderable in it, and which carries any face of Argument and Learning, is drawn out of two well-meaning Authors, who I believe had no deſign againſt Chriſtianity, but only to
<pb facs="tcp:42179:6"/>
advance their two ſeveral <hi>Hypotheſes</hi> they were wedded to. The firſt was the Author of the Hypotheſis of the <hi>Praeada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Vid. Ol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denburgi Collecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea ad Conringii Theſaur. Rerump.</note>, who ſeriouſly repented of his Book and his Errour before he died; the other is the Ingenious and Learned Author of the <hi>Archaeologiae Philoſophicae.</hi> And this makes up the far greateſt part of the Book. But by the way we cannot but obſerve the great Diſingenuity of Mr. <hi>Blount,</hi> who is the chiefeſt of theſe Epiſtlers, who takes no manner of notice of the Author of the <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adamitae,</hi> from whom he not only takes, but tranſlates all that is material almoſt in all his Letters: For in his firſt Letter to Mr. <hi>Gildon,</hi> from <hi>p. 8.</hi> to the end <hi>(i. e.) p. 19.</hi> there is nothing but a verbal Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation out of that Treatiſe, ſave only a word or two <hi>p. 15.</hi> interpoſed about Biſhop <hi>Taylor;</hi> and ſo again <hi>p. 218.</hi> to <hi>p. 226.</hi> out of the ſame Author, and nothing of his own, but ſome falſe Latins and Spellings, and ill Tranſlations. But to give the Reader a caſt how fit theſe Gentlemen are to encounter with Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, which ſtands eſtabliſhed by its own Evidence, and the Writings of ſo many Learned Men; let him caſt his Eye upon the laſt Page of that Book, where Mr. <hi>Blount</hi> has tranſlated a Quotation out of
<pb facs="tcp:42179:7"/>
               <hi>Scaliger de Emend.</hi> brought by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the <hi>Praeadamitae;</hi> now he tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlates <hi>Octingenties octagies,</hi> not eight hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and eighty, but <hi>eight hundred and eightſcore;</hi> as if the <hi>Romans</hi> had uſed to reckon by ſcores. He might altogether as well have made them number by Bakers-Dozens.</p>
            <p>As for the Objections I have taken out of this Book, I have not always kept my ſelf ſtrictly to the words I found there, but chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the ſence; becauſe otherwiſe ſometimes the Argument would be too long, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times too obſcure. I have generally dreſſed up the Arguments with that little varniſh which they uſually appear in from the Mouths of Infidels; becauſe for the moſt part their frothy Wit is the principal Part of their Objection; and therefore I have made <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lologus</hi> talk all along in their Vein, leaſt otherways they might pretend the Argument was marred. And this I hope will excuſe me to thoſe Pious Ears, for thoſe bold and Irreligious Expreſſions, they will meet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al in the Mouth of my Deiſt; which they muſt conſider are not mine, but theirs; and to be repeated in the Perſon of an Infidel, I hope will not appear Grating or Prophane.</p>
            <p>There is one thing in the laſt place which I would deſire the Reader's Candor in, and that is my Explication of the Moſaick Creation of the Stars, a little out of the
<pb facs="tcp:42179:7"/>
way of other Interpreters; which I would let him know, I do not deliver as my ſetled Opinion, by any Dogmatical Aſſertion, but only propound it Problematically, as a poſſible way of accounting for the relation of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which deſtroys the Infidels charge of Impoſſibility; and which at laſt I leave to the Reader's Judgment, either to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive or to reject.</p>
            <p>And ſuppoſe this Hypothetical Scheme not to be exactly true, which I am not very eager to contend for; the cauſe of Religion will not ſuffer by it, nor the Infidels reap any advantage from it. This is only a Point of Philoſophy and not Revelation; and if there be any Errour in it, I am to ſuffer for it and not <hi>Moſes.</hi> If this Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis be poſſible, it proves as much as is aimed at; for any way of ſhewing how <hi>Moſes</hi> his Account <hi>may be,</hi> is a good proof a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst thoſe who aſſert it <hi>impoſſible to be.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is my hearty Prayer to God, that theſe my weak endeavours may contribute ſomething towards the abating the Preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of this ſort of Infidelity; which if they ſhall do, I ſhall then reap an ample Recompence of this ſmall Trouble; and I ſhall be encouraged to publiſh the Remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of this Diſcourſe, which is to vindicate the other parts of Chriſtianity, from the like Exceptions and Blaſphemies of the Infidels.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>CRedentius</hi> was a Gentleman deſcended from a very Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and Honourable Family, whoſe Father had left him a very plentiful Eſtate, and what was yet a greater Token of his Kindneſs, had given him a Vertuous and Learned Education; ſo that by his good Genius and hard Study, he was accompliſhed beyond the generality of Perſons of his
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:42179:17"/>
Birth, to defend the Doctrines of his Religion, which he did with ſo much ſincerity profeſs. Now this Gentleman for the privacy of his ſtudies, and to gratify his Love to Retirement, had withdrawn from the Noiſe of the Town, which he ſeldom frequented and never liked; and had for a great while kept cloſe to a Country Houſe of his, not far from the City; which lay at ſuch a convenient Diſtance from the Town, whereby he could enjoy the Converſe of thoſe few Friends he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted in, and was freed from the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſits of others, who he thought would be apt to give Interruption to his more deſired Studies. Beſides this, he had ſomething more particularly obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in his Temper; that he never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to eſtabliſh any ſtrict Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with the Gentlemen about him; but only took care to maintain ſuch a civil Correſpondence with them, as might take off all Imputation of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſeneſs and Ill-Neighbourhood. Of theſe Acquaintance <hi>Philologus</hi> was one, a Gentleman of fine Parts, and very polite Learning; that hated the Town as much and <hi>Credentius,</hi> as was as great a Lover of Books and Solitude. To
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:42179:17"/>
this Gentleman <hi>Credentius</hi> had a liking beyond the reſt of his Neighbours; not upon account of his Principles, but his learned and diverting Converſation; and with whom he was wont to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy a great deal of entertaining Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, when the talk of the other Company was running upon Dogs and Horſes. <hi>Philologus</hi> comes one After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon to pay a Viſit to <hi>Credentius,</hi> whom he finds in his ſtudy among a very large and choice Collection of Books in moſt Arts and Sciences; which he had procured for himſelf with no inconſiderable charge: For he had taken care to be provided, not only with all Hiſtory, both Ancient and Modern, and with a Collection of Claſſick and Law-Books; but was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo furniſhed with all the Fathers and Councils of the beſt Editions, with a variety of the Bibles, Criticks and Commentators on the Scripture, and with a conſiderable number of the beſt Critical, Caſuiſtical and Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſial Divines. By reaſon of this, he was very ſerviceable to his Neighbouring Clergy, by giving them leave often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to ſtudy there; and by freely lending them ſuch Books, which their
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:42179:18"/>
circumſtances would not allow them to purchaſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Philologus</hi> entring familiarly upon him, as he was wont to do, ſees him buſy in writing ſomething out of a Volume of St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi>'s Works, whilſt the other Volumes lay by him. Dear Sir, ſays he, I am glad to ſee you. What? You are upon ſecuring your <hi>Credo?</hi> I ſee you are drawing out from thence ſome Detatchments to make good ſome weak place or other in it. <hi>Credentius</hi> was riſing up to make his Complement, and to bid him Welcome; but <hi>Philolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi> running to him ſtops him; ſaying he ſhould not ſtir, till he had made an end of his Muſter-Roll of Quotations, as he called it; that he did not come to give him diſturbance, but that he would wait his leaſure till he had done, and that in the mean time he would talk a word or two likewiſe with the old Conſtantinopolitan Biſhop. <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentius,</hi> after ſome preſſing, accepts the offer; who when he had tranſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed what he deſigned, he thus ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes himſelf to <hi>Philologus.</hi>

               <p>Well, Sir, I ſuppoſe you are weary of this old Father by this time, for your Palate does not ſerve you

               <p>In good truth, Sir, this old Gentlemen is very good Company: I did not think theſe grey beards had had ſo much Wit; I proteſt, here is a vein of fine Reaſoning and neat Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage; honeſt <hi>John</hi> would have made ſomething of it, if he had had the luck but to have lighted upon a better ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject: had he but made Speeches at the <hi>Areopagus,</hi> or the <hi>Forum,</hi> he might have made as good a figure as <hi>Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſthenes</hi> or <hi>Aeſchines;</hi> but as for Faith and Hope they are deadly dull ſubjects to play the Orator upon.</p>

               <p>How! Sir. What can be a better ſubject, than the great Creator of all things, his Eternal Son, his Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Mercy, the wonderful mazes and wiſe contrivances of his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; the Miracles and Sufferings of our Bleſſed Saviour, the Peace of a good Conſcience, and the Joys of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther World? Are not theſe, think you, as noble Themes, as the little ſquabbles of Landlords and Tenants, and the putting caſes between <hi>Caius</hi> and <hi>Titius?</hi>

Tales to thoſe whoſe Throats are wide enough to ſwallow them; but they lie croſs mine preſently: I am ſick of a Chapter in <hi>Mark</hi> before it is half done; for I muſt needs tell you nothing lies ſo hard upon my ſtomach, as a Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, or a Revelation. My Nurſe was a Popiſh Iriſh Woman, and ſhe told me ſuch ſtrange ſtories of the <hi>Patricks,</hi> the <hi>Bridgets,</hi> and the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſula's,</hi> that I took ſuch a ſurfeit before I was eight years old, that I never much cared for that ſacred food ſince. After I grew up, it is true, I have been more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant in Bibles than in Legends; but I find I ſhall be converted by both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like; for I have a Budget full of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions againſt the whole ſtory, there ſeems to be ſo much of the Sir <hi>Bevis</hi> in all the Relations; for in almoſt every page I meet with ſomewhat which turns my ſtomach from <hi>Geneſis</hi> to the <hi>Revelations.</hi> What a work do we make with <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, with Chriſt and the Apoſtles—</p>

much a Gentleman to abuſe but my Friend before me, and I think I may beſpeak of you as much Civility to my Saviour, which I am ſure I have more Reaſon for. Such Diſcourſe as this may be very edifying in a Club of you Wits; but as much as you laugh at my <hi>Credo's,</hi> I want Faith to think my ſelf ſecure amongſt thoſe that talk after this rate. You Gentlemen ought to be very ſecure of your Hand, and your Houſe too, let me tell you, before you ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to talk thus: I think my Houſe is none of the ſlendereſt built, and I take my Walls to be proof againſt any thing but Blaſphemy; but when Men make ſport with God and Religion, I am afraid of the Rafters cracking and the Bricks tumbling about my Ears. Therefore pray, Sir, let us go down and talk of ſomething elſe.</p>

               <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
               <p>Well, Sir, I ſee you want not Zeal, and I am ſorry I ſhould want good Manners. I beg your pardon heartly, ſince I have offended you; but for the future you ſhall ſee I will be as reſpectful to you upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count as you can deſire. I can bow if you pleaſe at the name of Jeſus as reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently as a Biſhop. I find I can learn a
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:42179:20"/>
Court Faſhion as well as <hi>Naman</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; nay, if I ſhould happen to go with them into the Houſe of <hi>Rimmon,</hi> my Conſcience would ne'er read me a Lecture of Idolatry, for I could e'en ſcrape a Leg as well as the beſt of them, and go in Peace. But when you tie up our Tongues from ſpeaking upon this ſubject, you will hinder us from a juſt information, ſo that we poor In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels will never be able to look <hi>Sion</hi>-wards. For my part I ſhould be very glad to take a view of the new <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> if I could but once ſee it; nay, I would make the beſt uſe of mine Eyes, and take the help of a little Opticks to diſcover it; but there ſeems to me to be ſo many difficulties in the Belief of revealed Religion, that I cannot fanſie any Man of ſenſe does really believe it. I know you have too much Reaſon to be impoſed upon by ſuch groſs fallacies; and if we were to meaſure I imagine your Creed and mine are much of the ſame length: You only are the ſilent, and I the Talking Unbeliever. I have a little more Impudence to keep me from bluſhing when I appear ſingular, and I have a back broad enough to bear the ill names the Parſons give me;
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:42179:20"/>
but you lie ſnug and keep your own Counſel, you ſet in with the Mob, and do as they do, only for fear of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hooted at. So that when all is done, I fanſie <hi>Credentius</hi> and <hi>Philologus</hi> are Believers both alike.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Cred.</speaker>
               <p>I am ſorry you ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſo ill an Opinion of me, ſeeing I am not conſcious I have given you any juſt occaſion for it. For I will aſſure you, as I have not taken up my Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion upon Truſt, ſo I do not profeſs the leaſt Article of it upon account of Popularity. I am ſo fully perſwaded <hi>of all the parts of the Truth</hi> of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion, I think it ſo admirable a Syſtem of Morality, ſo excellently contrived for the good of Mankind, the Rewards it promiſes and the Puniſhments it threatens, are founded upon ſuch firm and unſhaken grounds; that I would venture to maintain it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Contradictions of all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; and ſingularity ſhould be ſo far from diſcouraging me, that I would profeſs the Doctrine of the Croſs by my ſelf alone againſt the whole Infidel World. As for your Diſcourſing upon this ſubject, it is ſo far from being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful to me, that I think it the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:42179:21"/>
greateſt comfort and happineſs I can enjoy; to run over thoſe bleſſed Truths, which are the Comfort of my Life, and the Hopes of my Salvation; nay, I can eaſily hear what Objections you have to raiſe againſt them, if ſo be you will be pleaſed to urge them with Modeſty or with a Deſign to receive ſatisfaction; but I have no patience to hear you only expoſe and ridicule thoſe Doctrines, whilſt you are reſolved never to be convinced of their Truth.</p>

               <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
               <p>I might very well deſerve this Reprimand of yours, if I ſhould pretend to laugh at that Religion I did believe; but I muſt needs tell you as far as my Creed goes, I am a very ſtrong and Orthodox Believer, and a very ſtrict Obſerver of it. I only laught at ſome other ſilly Opinions, which I fanſie the reſt of the World are gull'd with; and why ſhould not I laugh at them, as well as they laugh at me? They call me Atheiſt, and make me their Fool, and I call them Bigotts and give them the ſame Livery. I have as much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, Sir, for Natural Religion as you can have for the Chriſtian, and I hope if I live up to that to be as happy here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after; therefore I preſume I may make
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:42179:21"/>
bold to be merry a little with your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, as your Gentlemen are with mine. I am ſure mine is of the ancien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Houſe; and <hi>Natural</hi> Religion is God's Law moſt certainly, whether your <hi>Revealed</hi> one, as you call it, be ſo or no. So that if I do not believe your Tenets, why ſhould not I make as much ſport with you, as you do with the Moon in <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s Sleeve?</p>

               <p>I confeſs I never liked making ſport with any Man's Religion,<note place="margin">Religion though er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous not to be ſcof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed at.</note> for it is not only a piece of Rudeneſs, but a very inhumane Cruelty; for it ſets a Man's Soul upon the Rack, to ſee that ridiculed, which he accounts moſt Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred. And perhaps that Precept in the Moſaick Law, <hi>Thou ſhalt not ſpeak evil of the Gods of the People,</hi> is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood in this ſence. For when the Jews were going into a ſtrange Country it was the moſt probable way to gain Proſelytes to their Law, rather to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate the Truth of their own, than to rail at the Heathens Religion. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that I was about to convert a Turk at <hi>Canſtantinople,</hi> can you think it was the moſt prudent way to railly upon <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s Peaſe and his Pidgeon, and his falling Sickneſs? I'll warrant you,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:42179:22"/>
I ſhould catch a Tartar inſtead of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting a Turk: 'tis ten to one, but the outragious Infidel revenged his Prophets Quarrel with his Scimeter; ſo that I ſhould make my ſelf a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr, inſtead of making him a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert.</p>

               <p>I beg your Pardon heartily, if I have ſpoken my thoughts a little too freely upon this ſubject, for I will aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure you I did not in the leaſt deſign to offend you; my only aim was to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue the Truth, and to hear what you can ſay upon this ſubject, wherein I promiſe my ſelf a great deal of ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; for then I am ſure I ſhall hear no common place Talk, but ſomething new and ſolid of your own ſtock. If you are convinced of the Truth of the Chriſtian Religion, I am certain it is upon ſtrong Arguments and weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty grounds; for as you are too wiſe to be impoſed upon by fallacy, ſo you are too honeſt to be byaſſed by Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt; therefore I may expect to hear ſomething more conſiderable from you, than from the Parſons, who are too well paid for making Speeches upon this Subject, to be Impartial in it. But I proteſt, Sir, I am no hardy, reſolved
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:42179:22"/>
Infidel, nor ſuch an one that has no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to ſay againſt Chriſtianity, but only to call it names; for I have ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny conſiderable Objections to urge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, that I muſt needs ſuſpend my Faith 'till I can ſee them anſwered. Nor are theſe my Objections only le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled againſt a word or two in the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or ſome few ſeeming Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which may perhaps be accounted for by different acceptations and varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Tranſcribers; but againſt the whole Compaſs and Tenor of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, which all ſeems to be Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious and contrary to Reaſon. For as far as ever I could perceive, Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſeem'd to conſiſt, or at leaſt was bottomed upon the Truth of theſe Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars. 1.<note place="margin">The Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars of the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</note>

of ſuch a Lapſe of Mankind, nor is there need of any ſuch Redemption, nor that the Books which are brought to prove all this, are of that Divine Authority they pretend to; you may then very well conclude, that I have ſomething more to ſay againſt your Religion, than ſome few flouriſhes of Wit and gay Periods, which your Clergy would make you believe, is all that Men of my Perſwaſion have to encounter it. Nay, I will add further if you can ſatisfy me in theſe Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, and clear up theſe Difficulties, I will profeſs Chriſtianity to Morrow; for it is not my Vices, but my Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as I told you, which hinder me from joining Communion with you; and I do not know but that I may live as vertuouſly and honeſtly as thoſe who go ſo gravely to Church, with black Caps and broad Bibles. And therefore if you pleaſe, <hi>Credentius,</hi> we will take a Walk in your Garden, and talk over a Point or two of this Subject; for the Weather is too hot, either to drink, or to ſtay within.</p>

               <p>I did not think, <hi>Philologus,</hi> to entertain you after this Philoſophical Manner. But pray, Sir, how long have
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:42179:23"/>
you been in love with the <hi>Peripatum?</hi> I thought you were too much of <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curus</hi> his Party, to take Example after <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s Sect. I ſhould think ſome other jolly Philoſopher were a more agreeable Pattern for you to take, than thoſe ſtingy Speculatiſts, who give their Friends a Walk to ſave their Wine. But if it is reſolved that you and I muſt enter the Liſts of a Diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion this Evening, I think it will not be inconvenient to walk abroad, for if we ſhall grow too warm there, we ſhall have Air to cool us.

               <p>This delicate Walk of Orange Trees, <hi>Credentius,</hi> puts me in mind of your Paradiſe, and conſequently of the <hi>Moſaick</hi> Creation; which is the firſt point which you and I muſt clear up. But I would not have you think that I find fault with this account, becauſe I am perſwaded with <hi>Epicurus,</hi> that the World was not made by God. For <hi>Epicurus</hi> was a Blockhead to entertain ſuch a ſilly thought as this; and no Man of common ſenſe, that ever thought, could be of his Opinion. I am as impatient as you can be, at the ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culouſneſs of his Philoſophy; for his
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:42179:24"/>
Doctrine of the Eternity, the weight and falling of Atoms, is but a Syſtem of Nonſenſe. For thoſe weighty Atoms of his would be always falling and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling through the infinite ſpace, and would never be able to meet together to frame a World; and one Atom could be no more able to join with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, than the Hind-wheel can over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the foremoſt. And as for that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or Side-Motion, which was afterwards added, I look upon to be but a pitiful Botch, to patch up this fooliſh Hypotheſis. I am fully ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied that the World had its Origin from a Wiſe or Powerful. Being, the firſt Cauſe of all things, from whoſe <hi>Eternal</hi> Womb all things have ſprung up, and whoſe Power and Goodneſs ſtill preſerves the World in the ſame ſtate in which it always was. So that I eſpy two principal faults in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the <hi>Moſaick</hi> Creation.<note place="margin">The Ground of Theiſm.</note> The firſt is, <hi>Becauſe he gives the World too late a being, it having a ſubſiſtence infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Ages before he ſays it had;</hi> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is, <hi>That ſuppoſing the World was Created in Time, and at the time he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, his account is ſo extravagant, that it cannot ſatisfy any reaſonable man.</hi> And
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:42179:24"/>
theſe two points in the firſt place, I think I ſhall be able to make out.</p>

               <p>Well! Sir, I ſee you have ranged your Exceptions very Methodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally: You are reſolved to find me work enough before you have done; for theſe Heads I preſume are teeming with an abundance of Objections, ſo that you will make me run through a Body of Divinity before I have anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them all. For my part I muſt main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the ground of Chriſtianity as well as I can, and I am ſorry it is like to ſuffer ſo much by ſo ill a Defender. But God be thanked I have a good Cauſe to ſet againſt your Wit and Parts; for I take every thing which can be ſaid againſt our Religion, to be ſo incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable, that very weak Parts, and a ſlender ſtock of Learning, will be able to encounter the moſt doughty Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments which can be urged againſt it.

                  <p>Why, Sir, the firſt thing I have to ſay againſt the Hiſtory of the Creation, as it is related by <hi>Moſes,</hi> is that he makes the World to begin but between five and ſix Thouſand years

ago, when it is demonſtrable it has continued from all Eternity. And this has been the Doctrine of the wiſeſt Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers heretofore. For to omit <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> and others of later date, I find <hi>Ocellus Lucanus</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Oracles of Reaſon, <hi>p. 216.</hi>
                     </note>, who was almoſt co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary with <hi>Moſes,</hi> if not before him, to have been of this Opinion; and he is ſo admirable a Philoſopher, that in a Queſtion of this nature, I would take his word before that of the Jewiſh Lawgiver. But his Book <hi>of the Nature of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſe,</hi> which is ſtill extant, gives us ſo many demonſtrative Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Truth of this Opinion, that we need go no farther than that Excellent Treatiſe to confute the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of the Creation.</p>

                  <speaker>Cred.</speaker>
                  <p>But before you proceed give me leave to remind you of a very great Errour, in aſſerting, that <hi>Ocellus</hi> the Author of that Treatiſe, was Precedent, or any thing nigh Co-temporary with <hi>Moſes.</hi> But ſuppoſing that Treatiſe to be wrote by <hi>Ocellus Lucanus,</hi> that anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent <hi>Pythagorean,</hi> there was no leſs than eleven hundred years diſtance between his Writing and <hi>Moſes</hi> his. For ſay that <hi>Moſes</hi> wrote ten Years after the <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi> coming out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> which was
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:42179:25"/>
                     <hi>An. Mundi,</hi> 2470. the Book of the Creation will then be wrote <hi>An. Mundi,</hi> 2480; but I will make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that <hi>Ocellus Lucanus,</hi> wrote but much about the year of the World 3580. which is eleven hundred years later. Now <hi>Ocellus Lucanus</hi> lived much about the time when <hi>Plato</hi> wrote, or perhaps a little before, being both Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporaries, but <hi>Ocellus</hi> the elder Man. For <hi>Plato</hi>'s School was in its moſt flouriſhing Condition in the 102 <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lympiad</hi> when he was about fifty years old,<note place="margin">Diog. L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

Mundi,</hi> 3525; and it is as plain that <hi>Ocellus</hi> lived much about the ſame time. For <hi>Laertius</hi> in the Life of <hi>Archytas</hi> gives us two Letters between <hi>Archytas</hi> and <hi>Plato,</hi> about <hi>Ocellus,</hi> who was lately Dead: <q>Wherein <hi>Archytas</hi> tells <hi>Plato,</hi> that he had undertook the Buſineſs of Publiſhing ſome Poſthumous Pieces of <hi>Ocellas,</hi> and upon that account had been with the Family of the <hi>Lucani,</hi> and particularly with <hi>Ocellus</hi> his Grand-Children, and had obtained the Papers of them, <hi>viz.</hi> his Book of Laws, of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, of Sanctity, <hi>of the Generation of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:42179:26"/>
the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſe;</hi> and adds, that he will ſend the other Pieces to him as ſoon as they ſhould be found.</q> To which <hi>Plato</hi> anſwers, that this was a very ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable preſent, that he very much admired the Writer, and that he was worthy of that moſt ancient deſcent from the <hi>Trojans.</hi> Now if <hi>Ocellus</hi> were ſo ancient a Writer as <hi>Moſes,</hi> how ſhould <hi>Plato</hi> never have ſeen his Books before? How ſhould it come into his Head to put <hi>Archytas</hi> upon ſearch after Books, which were wrote eleven hundred Years before? Or how could they be ſuppoſed to have lain dormant in the Family for ſo many Ages? If he had been as old as <hi>Moſes, Plato</hi> would never have mentioned his moſt ancient Deſcent from the <hi>Trojans;</hi> for <hi>Moſes</hi> lived long before thoſe <hi>Trojan</hi> Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors were born. But the Letter is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs that <hi>Archytas</hi> had this Book from his Grand-Children, which were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably his Heirs, and who had the right of diſpoſal of his Papers when he was Dead. So that it appears that this <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellus</hi> was ſo far from being a Writer as old as <hi>Moſes</hi> that he was but a late <hi>Grecian</hi> Writer. For not to mention <hi>Orpheus, Homer,</hi> and <hi>Heſiod,</hi> who lived
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:42179:26"/>
ſix or ſeven Centuries before; moſt of the Greek Books which are moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly read were much Ancienter than this Author. All the celebrated Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical Poets, <hi>Ariſtophanes, Aeſchylus, Euripides, Sophocles;</hi> all the <hi>Lyrick</hi> ones, <hi>Steſichorus, Alcaeus, Pindar, Sappho, Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monides, Anacreon;</hi> and other moral Poets Ancienter than theſe, <hi>Tyrtaeus, Theognis, Phocylides;</hi> beſides the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Hiſtorians <hi>Herodotus</hi> and <hi>Thucy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dides.</hi> But in reſpect of the Jewiſh Books he was but a writer of yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day; for he was ſo far from being able to vie with <hi>Moſes</hi> for Antiquity, that the very laſt Writer of the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment wrote before him: for the Canon was compleated, and the Prophecies ſealed up in <hi>Malachy</hi> who wrote al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt 40 years before this Writer. For <hi>Malachy</hi> flouriſhed in the firſt year of <hi>Artaxerxes Mnemon,</hi> and <hi>Ocellus</hi> not till about the 35th. So that we have proved not only <hi>Moſes,</hi> but the whole Bible, to be ancienter than this Old Writer.</p>
                  <p>But after all, I believe I can make it appear, that this Book, which you mention, is not ſo ancient as the Author it lays claim to; but was compoſed by
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:42179:27"/>
ſome modern in imitation of that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient piece of <hi>Ocellus</hi>'s which <hi>Archytas</hi> in his letter mentions. For there are ſome manifeſt marks which make it appear, that it is a piece of much later date than <hi>Ocellus Lucanus:</hi> 1. For it is known to all that the Ancient <hi>Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goreans</hi> wrote always in the Dorick Dialect, as appears by the works or fragments yet exſtant of <hi>Timaeus, Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crus,</hi> &amp;c. But this Treatiſe is wrote in common Greek; nay it is evident, that <hi>Ocellus</hi> himſelf wrote in Dorick,<note place="margin">Stob. Ecl. Phyſ. Lib. <hi>1.</hi> Cap. <hi>16.</hi>
                     </note> as does appear from what is quoted from him by <hi>Stobaeus</hi> in his Ecloges; <hi>viz.</hi> a fragment out of his Book of Laws, which <hi>Archytas</hi> ſays he wrote. In which fragment <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, &amp;c. ſhews plainly the Dialect in which this Author wrote. 2ly, We may obſerve that the Author of this Piece was an <hi>Ariſtotelian</hi> Philoſopher, who goes all along upon <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, <hi>viz.</hi> The four Elements: talks much of the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Elementary qualities, of the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutation of the Elements, of <hi>Antipe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtaſis,</hi> &amp;c. almoſt in the very words of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in his Books of Natural <hi>Auſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultation.</hi> So that inſtead of being as
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:42179:27"/>
old as <hi>Moſes,</hi> 'tis probable he may not be much older than <hi>Simplicius</hi> or <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponus.</hi>

                     </note> And this Dr. <hi>Cudworth</hi> in his Intellectual Syſtem has proved at large, to be the meaning of this Aſſertion of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>Atomick</hi> Philoſophers. But then, Sir, be pleaſed to conſider, what this Ax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iom has to do to confront the Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Power of God, in the firſt Creation; unleſs it can be proved that it implies an abſolute Impoſſibility, for God to create any thing out of nothing; which no one can reaſonably aſſert. Now no one can ſay it implies an abſolute Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility; for then ſuch Impoſſibility muſt ariſe either from want of Power in God to do it, or from ſome natural Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnancy in the thing it ſelf. It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not proceed from want of Power in God, for he is the Origin of all Power, and every thing that is poſſible to be done
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:42179:29"/>
can be done by him. To ſay the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility ariſes from the part of the <hi>Subject</hi> is as incongruous. For ſuch Impoſſibility muſt be cauſed from a <hi>Power of reſiſting</hi> in that thing, or from a <hi>Contradiction,</hi> which the doing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of would imply. But there can be no <hi>Power of reſiſting</hi> in any thing which is able to reſiſt the Divine Activity; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that and all other Power came from Him, which argues in Him a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Power. But as for the <hi>Subject</hi> of Creation, that is <hi>Nothing,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that to be ſure cannot give any Reſiſtance. There remains only to prove, that it implies no <hi>Contradiction</hi> to produce ſomething out of Nothing. Indeed <hi>to be</hi> and <hi>not to be</hi> at the <hi>ſame time</hi> implies a Contradiction, but to be and not to be at <hi>diverſe times</hi> does not; and the reaſon is obvious. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Exiſtence of a Thing in any one Inſtant does perfectly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude all poſſibility of non-exiſtence for that Inſtant; but the not being of a Thing in any Inſtant does not exclude any poſſibility of its being afterward, when God Almighty pleaſes. Now it is ſo far from being a Contradiction for a Thing to be produced out of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:42179:30"/>
by God-Almighty, that we find it (according to the Philoſophy of ſome) in ſome meaſure done even by finite Beings. For they account <hi>Accidents</hi> a ſort of Beings, which are produced by Creatures themſelves, out of nothing, by a kind of ſubordinate and delegated Creation, which God has given them the Power of, by Vertue of their Beings. Thus the Mind produces Thought, the Fire produces Heat, the Sun produces Light, which are all diſtinct from the Subſtances which produce them, and yet are generated out of <hi>nothing.</hi> But however both <hi>Thought</hi> and <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Heat,</hi> are real Beings, and do properly Exiſt, and are compoſed out of no Pre-exiſtent Matter, and therefore muſt be produced out of Nothing; either by the immediate Power of God continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally acting, which is moſt reaſonable; or by a ſubordinate Power communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to the Creature with its Being. Now, why is it not as eaſy for the Deity to produce Subſtance out of nothing by his Almighty Power, as it is for a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to produce Accidents by his finite and limited One? Or why could not God-Almighty produce all things out of nothing at firſt, as well as to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:42179:30"/>
theſe Accidents, Modes, or Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances every moment? All the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty which makes ſome Men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to allow this power to God is, becauſe we do not ſee any Inſtance of this before our eyes, being uſed only to Natural and Artificial Productions. We ſee Blood produced out of Food, and Fleſh out of Blood; we ſee the Juices of the Earth turned into Wood, the Wood into Smoak and Flame, whilſt the matter remains the ſame after thoſe ſo many alterations; and therefore we conclude that no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction or Corruption can be made any other way than this. We ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience that a Carpenter cannot build a Ship or a Houſe without pre-exiſting materials, and therefore we are apt ſillily to conclude that God himſelf can do no more; becauſe we cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive how he ſhould do it, or becauſe he muſt do it by other Methods, than thoſe which we are uſed to. But I pray, is not this as unreaſonable, as for a blind Man to deny, that any one can perceive Colours, becauſe he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not poſſibly conceive, how they ſhould be diſtinguiſh'd? And if there be other good Arguments to prove, that God
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:42179:31"/>
has Created the World out of nothing, it is in vain to deny it; becauſe it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceiveable by us, or contrary to the courſe of nature, ſince the Creation.</p>

                     </label> To this Argument, Sir, be pleaſed to take this Anſwer. 1ſt, That it is a thing ſomewhat uncertain, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or no the World continues in the ſame ſtate it was in at the beginning, moſt learned Men for many Ages have been of the contrary opinion, that it grows old and doth every day verge towards its final Deſtruction; and Dr. <hi>Hackwell,</hi> who wrote his Book of Providence about Threeſcore Years ago, was the firſt Man that had the Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to encounter with the received o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:42179:31"/>
and he raiſed himſelf not a ſmall number of Adverſaries upon it. But truly I am ſo far of that learned Mans opinion, as not to think any very remarkable decay is to be found in the World; for the Heavenly Bodies do obſerve the ſame motions, and when we eſpie any difference between the Ancient and Modern Accounts, it ought to be attributed to want of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actneſs in the old Calculations; the Bodies of Men are of the ſame magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude as is manifeſt by the Ancient mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of Digits, Feet, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and their natural parts or ingeny ſeem not at all to be impaired, as appears from the Modern Writings and Inventions. But if we conſider the primitive fecundity of the Earth, and its barrenneſs now adays; of which I will diſcourſe more by and by; which natural fruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is ſo celebrated in Ancient Writers under the name of the Golden Age; and if we further add the Longaevity of our Antediluvian Progenitors, and others for a conſiderable time after the Flood; one would be inclined to think, that nature has loſt much of its primitive ſtrength it enjoy'd, when the Earth was impregnated with its juvenile vigour.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Creation of the World not like or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions.</note>2ly, There is no neceſſity, becauſe the World is produced in time, that this primary production ſhould in all reſpects anſwer to our natural and common productions. I confeſs I have always took it to be not only an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modeſt but an ignorant way of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to ſay God muſt act ſuch a way, becauſe nature ſo requires it, that other-ways it would not be a natural way of acting and the like; as if God was not the God of nature, as well as of every thing elſe; or that the power of God muſt be bounded by that of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. So in the preſent caſe, becauſe Men ſee that we are firſt Infants, then Children, afterwards Men, and laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Old Men, which is the ſeries from our Production to our Diſſolution; therefore ſome conclude, that the like muſt follow from the Production of the World. I remember there is a notable Diſpute in <hi>Macrobius,</hi> which was oldeſt, a Hen, or an Egg. And I think that Queſtion might be eaſily ſolved, by ſaying, that naturally the Egg is before the Hen, becauſe ſhe is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated out of it; but in the firſt Creation the firſt Hen was produced ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, otherways than from an Egg,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:42179:32"/>
becauſe there was no preceding Hen to lay it. And the Anſwer is the ſame to the matter in hand. All natural Productions do proceed in the aforeſaid Method <hi>from worſe to better,</hi> &amp;c. but the Creation of the World is a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Production, precedent to all the Laws of Nature, which were to be obſerved after the firſt Production, but were impoſſible to be obſerved be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>

But did never any thing come to an end, but what had ſome viſible decay before it? Was never any Man kill'd or did die, but only by a lingring Sickneſs? Is not an Houſe as liable to be deſtroyed by Fire or Earthquake, as by Delapidati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? For we do not expect that the World ſhould be deſtroyed, from the defect of ſome internal Principle there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; but by the Will of God, and by the withdrawing his preſerving Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, which keeps it in its frame and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:42179:33"/>
We do not think, that the World ſhall decay like an old Houſe, piece by piece; but juſt like the ſtopping of a Clock all of a ſudden, when the Weights are down: For when it ſhall pleaſe God to withdraw that Divine Energy, which informs this great Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chine and ſets it a moving; all the Wheels of Nature will be checked in an Inſtant, and move no more for ever; and if he does likewiſe deny his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving Power, which keeps the parts in their being, even the very matter of them muſt crumble and ſink into no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>

                  <p>Well, Sir, let this be as it will, I have another knotty piece of Work for you, and that is another Argument of <hi>Ocellus</hi>'s; which is this. If the World be created, then is the Univerſe created, for I call the World by the name of the Univerſe, being a perfect Collection of all Natures, for beſides the Univerſe there is nothing, and if there be any thing it is contained in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, either as a part or an excreſcence thereof; now to make the Univerſe, or every thing to be Created implies a Contradiction; for if every thing be Created, there will be nothing left to

create ſo that it muſt upon this ſcore be aſſerted, that ſomething muſt create it ſelf, which of all contradictions is the moſt abſurd. Does not this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection pinch a little?</p>

Majeſty of the Deity, for we ſhall ſecure all his attributes this way, as well as you can yours: For I look upon the World both to be Eternal and Infinite, which are the two great Foundations of the Notion of a Deity: For there never was a time in which there was not this vaſt extenſion of matter regularly ordered as it is now, and there is no part of ſpace but what is poſſeſſed by ſome Beautiful Machine or other, which its Inhabitants eſteem a World: Now the Collection of theſe Wonderful Beings, The All, or the Univerſe, is what I call God.

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:42179:36"/>
worſe implies both a weakneſs in his former Knowledge, and a Diminution in his Subſequent Power. But it is not ſo when a change is made by the Divine Nature in its Creatures; for that is but agreeable to the Excellence of that Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Being, whoſe Goodneſs and Bounty ſeem neceſſarily to require it. For if there were no change to be made in the Creatures, it would hinder that large communication of the Divine Goodneſs to his Creatures, and would hedge in God's Bounty within narrow bounds. For if there never was to be but one ſet of Individuums in the World, and they only were to live along to Eternity; not the thouſandth part of Beings would enjoy that communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Happineſs, which now they do.

For who ever ſaid that God <hi>was</hi> becauſe he <hi>would be?</hi> They rather ſay God <hi>is,</hi> becauſe he <hi>muſt be;</hi> there is a neceſſity, that there ſhould be ſome primary Cauſe of things, which was neceſſarily of himſelf, and <hi>could not but be,</hi> but all other things depend upon his <hi>Will,</hi> and are becauſe <hi>he would have them be.</hi> And ſo it is in all the attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes of the Divine Nature. God-Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty is neceſſarily <hi>omnipotent,</hi> not becauſe he has a mind to be ſo. He is <hi>Pure,</hi> and <hi>Juſt</hi> and <hi>Merciful</hi> becauſe he cannot be otherways. But to make the nature of God conſiſt in this ſeries of <hi>Voluntary Mutations,</hi> is to be guilty of the moſt abſurd and manifeſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, becauſe it is to aſſert an Effect Prior to its Cauſe. For to ſay the nature of God is ſo, becauſe he will have it ſo, is to make an Act of Voli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is the Effect of the Divine Nature or Underſtanding, to be the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:42179:37"/>
cauſe of it: the act of <hi>Willing</hi> ſuppoſes an underſtanding nature before, and the nature <hi>Willed</hi> ſuppoſes it yet not to be.</p>
                  <p>Neither can theſe changes of the Deity, or this ſucceſſive nature of God (which is here aſſerted) be neceſſary neither.<note place="margin">Nor neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary.</note> There is but one thing in the World <hi>of it ſelf</hi> neceſſary, and that is God, and all other things which are neceſſary are ſo, becauſe his Will has determined them. God neceſſarily is becauſe he can have no cauſe, but we cannot ſay ſo of any thing elſe. We cannot ſay that ſuch particular Men, or Horſes or Trees are neceſſarily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we can aſſign a cauſe of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction, namely God, who might (if he pleaſed) not have produced them. Nay though 'tis only probable that God produced them, or if 'twere only poſſible they might not have been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by him, it were argument e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough againſt the neceſſity of their Being. But farther, to make all theſe Beings to be only the neceſſary Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of the Deity, is not only to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy all Religion, but even Free-will and common ſence. For why ſhould I praiſe God and honour him for this
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:42179:37"/>
noble Being I enjoy and for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of this Life, which (according to this opinion) he could not but afford me; any more than I ſhould thank the Clouds, for letting down thoſe Rains, which they could not keep up? I am as ſure, that I have a Free will, as I am ſure of any concluſion in the World; and therefore I am ſure that any Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which ſhall go about to prove a neceſſary Fatality is falſe. I am ſure I have a Liberty to walk or to ſit, and therefore to ſay theſe actions are but the neceſſary productions or emanations of the Deity, is to ſay what I know to be falſe; which will be ſo far from perſwading a Man, that it will only ſerve to enrage him. And laſtly this opinion contradicts the common-ſence and experience of all Mankind. For if theſe continual mutations, which we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold in the World, (as Generations, Corruptions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) are but the neceſſary Exhibitions of the Deity, then they cannot be promoted or hindred by the interpoſition of any thing elſe; the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary of which is manifeſtly evident. For how many Men are killed in Wars or Duels by the Ambition or Malice of others? How many Animals (as
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:42179:38"/>
Sheep, Hens) have their Breed incour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aged by Men, and many (as Wolves and Lyons) diminiſhed or deſtroy'd? How many contribute to the Decreaſe of Mankind by a Voluntary Celibacy, and how many towards the Increaſe of it by Marriage, or Polygamy? To ſay nothing of the Devaſtations made by God himſelf in Plagues, Earthquakes, Famines and the like. So that theſe ſucceſſive Generations are ſo far from being the neceſſary Effects of the Deity which he cannot alter himſelf; that they are lyable to the alterations of thouſands of his Creatures.</p>

<pb n="47" facs="tcp:42179:39"/>
from the Spherical Figure of the World? Becauſe a Sphere is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out beginning, or ending, therefore the World which is Spherical is ſo too. Does not every one know, when we ſay a Sphere is without beginning or ending, we mean one thing, and when we ſay God or the World is ſo, we mean another? The one we ſay, has no be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning or end in reſpect of Menſura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; It is not of a long Figure, the Extremities of which we call the two ends, at one of which we begin when we meaſure it; but the parts thereof lie equally diſtant from the Centre, it is neither long nor broad, and if you meaſure it there is no aſſign'd part or end to begin at, but you may begin your computation where you pleaſe, and ſo in this ſence we ſay it has no be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning or end. But when we ſay God or the World has no beginning nor end, we mean it in reſpect of Duration; that there ſhall be no period of Time, to bound their Being; or their Nature, or Exiſtence never had a beginning; which is quite another thing.</p>
                  <p>But granting you mean by this, that the Spherical Figure of the World does infer the perpetuity of its motion,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:42179:40"/>
or duration, the Argument is weak on all ſides.<note place="margin">No conſtat of the Sphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricalneſs of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe.</note> For 1ſt, that the Figure of the World is Spherical is more than moſt will allow, or indeed any Body, but thoſe who ſtick to the old Mump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimus of Solid Orbs. The Figure of the World or Univerſe may be ſquare or oval, or any other Figure for ought that we know, as well as Spherical. The Figure indeed of ſo much of it, as appears to us, is a Sphere, but that is no more Argument that it is ſo, than that the Moon is a white, yellowiſh ſhining Plate, about the bigneſs of the Crown of ones Hat, when ſhe is at full. We ſee in the Day time, that Arch of rag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Clouds hovering over our Heads equally to the Eye diſtant from the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies of the Earth; which, with the refracted Rays of Light that with a blewiſh Colour fill up the Interſtices, ſeem to form the half of a Sphere. And in the Night time, we view a mighty number of Stars, which, conſidering their remoteneſs from the Earth, ſeem all equally diſtant, and ſo form an ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary Sphere; as when by pricked lines, we repreſent a ſquare or a circle, as well as by continued ones. And this eſpecially is repreſented more live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lily
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:42179:40"/>
and ſeemingly real when the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices, between the Stars, are filled up with a pale ſcatter'd light. And upon this account it is, that we have in our eyes, the Image of a great white He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſphere, ſtudded with Stars. But this does no more conclude the World to be a Sphere, than the nine Pins ſet up by three and three, make a real ſquare, tho' we may conceive it to be one; or that Figure of the part of any Object, which lies next to the eye, and is ſeen by it, is the Figure of the whole. part of which lies behind undiſcerned. 2ly,<note place="margin">That no Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of a perpetual Motion.</note> But granting the Univerſe was Spherical, it would not from thence acquire a perpetual motion. A Spherical Figure makes a thing move more eaſily, but it does not make it always move. For otherways, Tops and Balls once put in motion would never ceaſe. Nay, ſhould you only aſſert, that the motion of the parts of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, the Earth, Planets, Sun and Stars, is circular, and therefore they move E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally, the conſequence would be very falſe. And this opinion is more rationally maintained by ſome modern Theiſts, who embrace the <hi>Corpernican</hi> and <hi>Carteſian</hi> Hypotheſis. But firſt,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:42179:41"/>
it will not be granted, that all the parts of the Universe do move in a circle; for 'tis plain that many of them move in an Ellipſis, and Comets in a Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bola. But ſecondly, though they did move circularly, they could not naturally move infinitely.</p>

                  <p>But give me leave to interupt you, before you go any further. I thought you had been too much a Philoſopher, to deny, that a thing once in motion, without impediment would move infinitely. I know a Stone or an Arrow cannot move on in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely, because of the renitency of a groſs Medium which hinders it; but what ſhould hinder the Earth, the Sun, or any one of the Planets from doing ſo?</p>

                  <speaker>Cred.</speaker>
                  <p>The thing which you take for granted, <note place="margin">Motion of Bodies in contiguity with Bodies not Infinite.</note>that a thing once in motion without external impediment will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways move, will remain a Question 'till we know what motion is, which we never ſhall. Indeed I will not absolutely deny, that a Body once moving in a vacuum would ever ceaſe. But this I will deny, that a body moving in contiguity with other Bodies can naturally and of it ſelf move infinitely. Now this Earth of ours, as all the other Planets and Stars;
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:42179:41"/>
move or ſwim in the liquid Aether, which how fine and ſubtile ſoever it be, is ſtill a Body. 'Tis needleſs to go to prove the reality of this fluid Body, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe (not to mention the exploſion and crepitancy of nitro-ſulphureous Bodies, Accenſion, and Fermentation, &amp;c.) the communication of Light from the remoteſt Stars do neceſſarily infer it; for go upon whatever Hypotheſis you will to explain Illumination by, you muſt agree upon ſuch an Interme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Body to convey it in. But it is moſt probable that Light is nothing elſe, but this Intermediate Body, or the Aether, the Trepidation of which ariſing from the Original Luminous Body, and communicated from one particle to another all along the ſpace, ſtrikes at laſt upon the Organ, and makes in us the Idea of what we call Light. Now ſince this is a Body, it has the Property of Body and that is Impenetrability, and conſequently Reſiſtability, and whatſoever reſiſts another Body in Motion, either changes the term of its Motion and returns it back again; or elſe abſorbs part of its Motion; both which are inconſiſtent with an equable Eternal
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:42179:42"/>
Motion. Now ſince the Earth, and every Planet, moves in the Aether, the Aether muſt ſome way or other retard the motion of it: For ſince it is not of ſolidity enough to drive the Earth back, it muſt by continual, though little impulſes weaken its Motion; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Motion of the Earth can never be Eternal. It will not avail to ſay, that theſe checks or impulſes of this fine matter are but ſmall and inſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant, for though they be never ſo ſmall, they will in an infinity of time perfectly abſorb the whole Motion of the Earth, or any other Planets, and leave them at laſt dead moveleſs heaps of matter. So that ſuch a circular motion is not naturally Eternal; nay that it is of any very long continuance, it muſt be beholding to the conſervative Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God which we can give no natural Reaſon for.</p>

                  <p n="1">
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Arg. I.</hi> From the nature of Petrifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note>1ſt, I ſhall prove the World is not Eternal from the nature of <hi>Petrification,</hi> or the Growth of Stones and other Oſſeous Subſtances. It is granted by all that Stones do grow, and Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers have made it clear, that the way of their Augmentation is by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion of ſaline particles, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their commixture with more or leſs terreous matter, make them either Fine as Adamants, or Courſe as Pebbles and Free-Stone. Now by experience we find it; that theſe concretions are ſo ſtrangely du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, that hardly any time is able to diſſipate and diſſolve them; for the Marbles in the Great Pyramid in <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> which lie inwards and are not expoſed to the waſhings of the Rains, and the frettings of the nitrous Air, are not in the leaſt decayed for all they
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:42179:43"/>
have ſtood there ſo many thouſand years. Now if Stones do continually increaſe and there be no ſenſible Decay of them; upon ſuppoſition that the World has continued from Eternity, the whole World would be turn'd by this time into one Maſſy Rock by this Eternal <hi>Petrification,</hi> for many Ages ago the Earth would have been incultivable, at leaſt Men muſt have made uſe of Crows and Mattocks, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of Ploughs. And we may fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther obſerve the inclination of the Earth to <hi>Petrification</hi> in places unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited or diſpeopled, as particularly in <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> which formerly was a place luxuriantly fruitful, but ſince by the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage of the <hi>Romans</hi> and the <hi>Turks</hi> the Inhabitants are ſo much thinned, the Ground is grown ſtony and Barren for want of Cultivation. I ſay for want of Cultivation, for Tillage does macerate and break the Stony Earth again into a fine and kind ſoil, which is fit for vegetation; and therefore, in theſe Cultivated parts of the World, we are not ſo ſenſible of the increaſing <hi>Petri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,</hi> as we are in the uncultivated ones. Beſides I am apt to fanſie that the ſubſidency of the Sea in moſt parts
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:42179:44"/>
of the World is in ſome meaſure owing to the employing a great part of its ſaline Particles in the production of Stones which are partly concreted out of them; for theſe thin ſalts, which are from thence drawn up with the Miſts and Rains, are the principles of Petrification. Now this Argument may be further improved if we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Duration of <hi>Oſſeous</hi> and <hi>Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceous</hi> ſubſtances far exceeding the time of their Production. The Bones of Animals are produced in a little time, and are not diſſolved in a very great one. The ſhells of Oiſters, Muſſels, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are concreted in one Year, and yet laſt many thouſands; as appears by thoſe Beds of ſhells we find in the Tops of Hills which have lain there at leaſt ever ſince the Deluge. So that to any Inquiſitive Man it is plain, that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is every day more and more over-taking her ſelf, and as it were treading upon her own heels. For if the World had continued an Infinity of time, we ſhould have been all over-run with theſe <hi>Oſſeous</hi> and <hi>Conchous</hi> ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, and no matter left among us proper for Vegetation. And indeed we cannot but obſerve a kind of a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimony
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:42179:44"/>
in Nature, as if ſhe was afraid of this, by the ſpeedy corruption and reſolution of moſt Animals and Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables, by a natural principle which we generally call Fermentation: For there is an active ſpirituous Matter lodged in the compoſition of Plants, Flowers, Fleſh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which after the vital Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple is gone, does, by an agil, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal motion, ſhatter the compages in pieces, that Nature may make uſe of the parts again for another Work: juſt as Printers are uſed to knock their Letters aſunder, when the Sheet is wrought off. Now unleſs Nature was afraid of wanting a ſufficient ſtock of this fine matter, and being reduced to the ſaxeous and unpliable, which ſhe ſees every day to grow upon her, ſhe cannot be ſuppoſed to make ſuch pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate haſt, in the diſſolution of her former Productions; eſpecially when Animals and Vegetables are ſo incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable a part of the bulk of the Earth. I do not ſay, that this encreaſe of ſaxeous matter is any great inconvenience to the Earth already, or ever ſhall be if it continues but ſome few thouſand years more, or that this is any imperfection in this great Work of the Deity; for
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:42179:45"/>
it is well enough contrived for a World of ſome thouſand years Duration, but not for an Eternal one; the World will keep very well in repair for ſo ſhort a time, and therefore God Almighty does not ſee ſufficient reaſons to amend theſe ſmall decays; juſt as we when we have but a ſhort time in a Houſe or Eſtate, we take little care to repair it, if it be like to laſt well enough out our time.</p>

II.</hi> From the ſinking of Hills.</note>My next Argument I ſhall draw from the <hi>ſubſidency of Hills,</hi> and the daily landing up the Sea; which are things inconſiſtent with the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the World. For if the World has been from all Eternity there could no where have been found ſuch a thing as a Hill, for millions of Ages ago the higheſt Hills would have been all waſhed down into the Sea, and the Earth would have been reduced to an abſolute Level; ſo that the Waters would have totally overflowed it, and rendered it unhabitable. That the Hills are continually a ſinking, being waſhed down by the Rains, and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times vaſt Rocky parts of them tumbled
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:42179:45"/>
into the Vales by Storms, is undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to thoſe that have ſeen the many great Stones, which lie at the Bottoms of Hills in <hi>Wales</hi> and <hi>Switzerland;</hi> to thoſe that have obſerved ſome parts of the Walls of old <hi>Rome</hi> to lie thirty or forty foot under ground, and other higher parts of the City, as the Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tol, to have their foundations wholly extant above ground, and at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the ſame Mountain, the Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phal Arch of <hi>Septimius</hi> almoſt whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly overwhelmed in the Earth. Again, it is plain by obſervation, that the Tops of many Towers of Churches have been ſeen of late from ſome pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which they have formerly been hid from, by the interpoſition of an high Hill, which ſince it has been partly waſhed down by the Rains, has diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the Steeple which for ſome Ages before lay hid; nay we can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſee any old building, of but an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Years ſtanding, that is built in low ground, but we may obſerve the foundations to lie much deeper than they were at firſt laid; which can be nothing, but the Earth waſhed from the Hills and lodged there. So that we muſt needs grant, that the World
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:42179:46"/>
is ſo far from having continued an Eternity of time or being like to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue ſo, that it is every day more and more haſtening to its ruin by an inun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation; if it had been Eternal, long ago the Hills would have been all ſunk into the Valleys, the ſubſiding Earth would have choaked up the very Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels of the Seas, ſo that the whole World would have been one circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed Ocean, or at leaſt a noiſom un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inhabitable Marſh. To ſay this would be millions of Ages coming to paſs is nothing, for the longeſt time bears no proportion to Eternity: if a Diſh of Water only once in a thouſand years were thrown upon Mount <hi>Caucaſus</hi> ſo as to come down juſt dirty, in an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity of time it would have fetched done all that Prodigious Mountain, and laid it as plain as a Bowling-Green. Now this one Argument is ſo plain and ſo demonſtrative, that it is enough for ever to ſilence your Theiſtical E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity of the World.</p>

                  <p>'Tis time enough to triumph, when you have gain'd the Victory; this Thunder bolt has not ſtruck us ſo perfectly dumb, but we have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to ſay for our ſelves yet. We
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:42179:46"/>
will readily grant you, that an Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of time would waſh down all the Hills into a Level, but then that would not hinder the Riſe of new ones to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the Defect of the old. For the Earth has a Quality of lifting up it ſelf, or at leaſt is elevated by Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes, or Subterraneous Flatus's into new Hills when the ancient ones are leveled; ſo that there have been never wanting Mountains and Hills to drain off Rain from, to afford mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for Fountains and Springs. Nor is this only a random Bolt without ground, but is founded upon very good Authority. For <hi>Ovid. Met. Lib.</hi> 15. gives an account out of the <hi>Pythago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi> Writers of a Hill by <hi>Trezen,</hi> in the <hi>Peloponneſe,</hi> that was raiſed out of the plain ground; and in the laſt Age, in the Year 1538. a Hill now called <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te de Cinere,</hi> not far from <hi>Puzzuolo,</hi> the old <hi>Puteoli,</hi> was raiſed by an Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake; and both<note n="*" place="margin">Strab.

                     <hi>Strabo</hi> and <hi>Pliny</hi> give an account of ſeveral Iſlands being in the like manner raiſed in the Sea, which if they had been upon the Land, would have been eſteemed Hills. 'Tis true theſe Elevations are but ſeldom, becauſe there is no need in nature that
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:42179:47"/>
they ſhould be more frequent, becauſe a Hill is many Ages a waſhing down, and therefore if a ſupply of a new one happen once in an Age, it is abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſufficient.</p>

                  <speaker>Cred.</speaker>
                  <p>It is a great ſign of a through Confutation, when Men take ſhelter in ſuch mere Poſſibilities, that there is not the leaſt grain of Probability in. Becauſe a ſmall Hill or two have been raiſed by an Earthquake,<note place="margin">No new Hills rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed which are conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable.</note> why ſhould we ſuppoſe all the Hills and Mountains in the World were ſo? Becauſe ſome Men die violent Deaths, therefore we may as well conclude none die natural: becauſe there are ſome Monſtrous Births, there are none born in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine ſpecies. This is really, Sir, a mad random way of arguing, which none will make uſe of, that have any thing elſe to ſay. But to ſpeak to your Inſtances, as to <hi>Ovid</hi>'s Inſtance of the Hill by <hi>Trezen,</hi> that might in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability be nothing but a hear-ſay ſtory of the Neighbouring People; many hundreds of ſuch like we have amongſt us here in <hi>England,</hi> and yet we ſhould make mad work of it, if we ſhould go to Philoſophize upon them. The Poet does not give any greater proof of this
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:42179:47"/>
than he does of his other fictions, and therefore it does not deſerve any great Authority. Beſides he calls this but <hi>Tumulus</hi> a Hillock, on which not ſo much as a Tree grew,
<q>
                        <l>Eſt prope Pitthaeam cumulus <hi>Trezona</hi> ſine ullis</l>
                        <l>Arduus arboribus—</l>
                     </q>
and what is this to the Productions of ſuch vaſt Mountains as <hi>Caucaſus</hi> and the <hi>Alps?</hi> as to the other Inſtances out of <hi>Strabo</hi> and <hi>Pliny,</hi> every one knows what truſt thoſe Authors repoſe in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of common fame, to ſay nothing of the ſincerity of the Authors them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. But granting them true, they will not be able to ſupport your Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis as you ſhall ſee by and by. The Inſtance of the Hill by <hi>Puzzuolo</hi> is unexceptionable, and perhaps ſeveral others have been raiſed by the ſame means. But then this is no very great Hill,<note place="margin">Phyſico-Theol. Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes on the Chaos, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </note> it is but a 100 foot perpendicular at the moſt, and makes a great ſound under a Mans feet that ſtamps upon it, as Mr. <hi>Ray</hi> who has been upon it does teſtify. So that this is but a thin Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering Hill, the ſides of which are ſo very ſlight, that it diſcovers the Hallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs within, which is not to be perceived
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:42179:48"/>
in any other Hills; and therefore ought not to be brought as a Precedent, to prove the like Production of them. But granting this your Hypotheſis true of the ſucceſſive riſing of new and great Hills, and that ſubterraneous Accen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions were of force ſufficient to raiſe up the <hi>Alpes</hi> and <hi>Pyrenees;</hi> this will by no means agree to common Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience and Reaſon. For if this be the way, by which the World main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains its Eternity, then all the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains in the World muſt millions of times have been waſh'd down and blown up again into the form we ſee them, ſo that they can be none of them abſolutely ſolid, but the Sides and Tops ſupported in manner of an Arch. Upon this it follows that the more Copped and Pyramidical any Hill is, the more Hollow it is, and the Sides the thinner; for if the accenſion be made very deep in the Earth and an elevation follows, it will make a large riſe of mighty circumference and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perceptible aſcent of the nature of an Iſland, rather than a Hill. So that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Hill ſo generated muſt be very hollow, and the Rains by long waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, will at laſt waſh away the Top
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:42179:48"/>
and diſcover the Hollow. If this Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis were true, to be ſure ſome time or other we ſhould hear of Horſes and Carriages breaking through the worn Cruſts of ſome old mouldering Mountains, and being abſorbed in their Hollows; if this were true, we ſhould in many places of the World, ſee only the ſides of the hollow Hills with their Tops dilapidated, which would appear nothing like a Hill, but like the ragged Walls of an old <hi>Roman Amphitheater,</hi> open at Top, and incloſed round with its ſides. Now becauſe we ſee no ſuch Appearances as theſe, in any part of the World, which would moſt certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly come to paſs, if this Hypotheſis was true; we muſt therefore in all reaſon conclude, the Hypotheſis is falſe, and that Mountains do not in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner decay, and riſe as is here ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed.</p>

                  <p>Perhaps we may live in ſuch Ages, when no ſuch dilapidations hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen; or the Hills might all or moſt riſe together ſome few thouſand years ago, and ſo may not be out of repair ſince.</p>

of nature are not all together; Men, Beaſts and Trees, are born, flourish and die one after another continually, and ſo 'tis incredible to think ſo many thouſand Hills were produced ſo many thouſand years ago, and never an one ſince. Had not a Man better acquieſce in the Moſaick Account, than to involve himſelf in an Hypotheſis which is attended with all theſe ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities, and muſt be defended with ſuch mere poſſibilities?

                  <speaker>Cred.</speaker>
                  <p>My next Argument is drawn from the Increaſe of Mankind. If we look back into Hiſtory, we ſhall find the World much thinner ſtocked with People than it is now. It appears by the Books of ſo late Writers as aHomer and Heſiod, that Mankind generally in thoſe days led a ſort of a Paſtoral Life, and oftentimes changed their abode from one Country or one part of a Country to another; which could not ſo frequently happen, if the World had been as populous as it is now; for then every parcel of Land would be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:42179:49"/>
by diſtinct Proprietors, who would not give place to any new comers. But in thoſe dayd, Countries had ſo thin a ſtock of inhabitants, that there was Land ſufficient, not only for ſingle perſons, but alſo for vaſt Colonies of Men; which before it was occupied by them lay pro derelicto, for any body that would take it, there is nothing more famous in American Hiſtory, than theſe tranſmigrations of Inhabitants from one Country to another. Every one knows of Cadmus's Plantation in Boeotia, of his Brother Cilix his in Cilicia, of Dido's in Africa; of the Colonies ſettled by Evander, Aeneas, and Diomedes in Italy; to ſay nothing of our Engliſh Brute and the ſwarming Invaſions of the Saxons and Danes, and a hundred other Inſtances. For there is hardly any Nation almoſt, but owes their Original to ſome Colony planted there, within the reach of Hiſtory. We may conſider further, what vaſt Woods have been deſtroyed to make room for Inhabitants, as the World has Increaſed; the vaſt Hercynian Wood in Germany which took up ſo great a part of that might Country, and that of Arduena in Gaul. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:42179:50"/>
further, how mightily this Nation of ours has increaſed within a Century or two; notwithſtanding the many Civil and External Wars, and thoſe vaſt drains of People that have been made into our Plantations ſince the diſcovery of <hi>America;</hi> how the City of <hi>London</hi> has doubled it ſelf within theſe 40 years notwithſtanding the laſt great Plague, and how the Country has increaſed, tho' not in the like, yet in a conſiderable proportion. Now to lay all this together, it is no leſs than Demonſtration, that there has been a gradual Increaſe of the World for theſe 3000 Years, that it is far more populous now, than it was then, and that nature inclines ſtill more and more to Augment the ſtock; ſo that, tho' we ſhould not grant the World a Being from all Eternity, but only ſuppoſe it was four or five thouſand years before the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Account; Mankind by this time would have been perfectly wedged together, we ſhould have ſwarmed every where with nothing but men, moſt other ſpecies would in all probability, have been eaten up for food, and Men themſelves would have lived, like fiſhes, by ſnapping up one another.</p>

                  <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
                  <p>By your good leave, Sir, I cannot be brought to believe all this. For nature does in a very prudent man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner provide againſt the exceſſiveſt ock of Mankind, by cutting off the exube<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Increaſe by Wars, Famines, and eſpecially Plagues, and for ought I know, by Deluges, ſuch as they tell us of <hi>Deucalion</hi> and <hi>Noah.</hi> So that tho' Mankind does for ſome years ſeem to increaſe, yet it is always brought to the Level again, by ſome ſuch mighty devaſtation. For a great Plague or a Famine might deſtroy as much in one year, as the World had increaſed in five thouſand. And 'tis my Opinion, that the Eternity of the World is kept up by theſe ſucceſſive Increaſes and Deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations. And there is very good Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for this Opinion; becauſe this gives a fair account of the uſe of Plagues and Famines in the World; for ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious corruptions in the Air do not ſeem to be the pure Errors and Blunders of nature; but to be wiſely contrived to obviate the Inconveniencies, which would ariſe from an over-grown ſtock; beſides ſuch Methods of Nature would ſeem cruel and unmerciful, unleſs ſhe had a deſign to ſerve, which was ſo
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:42179:51"/>
very neceſſary which Imputation is fairly taken away by this Hypotheſis.</p>

                     <note place="margin">The World never depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulated by Plagues.</note>But then your Hypotheſis ought to be grounded upon ſome Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or Experience, before you advance it; but it is ſo far from being founded on them, that it is contrary to the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Experience of all Mankind. We have very good Hiſtory of what has happened, for 3000 years laſt, and yet we never heard of any Devaſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion like this. The great Plague of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,</hi> that unparallelled one in the ſixth Century, which raged ſo all over the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, for the ſpace of fifty years, and that which happened in our City of <hi>London</hi> thirty years ago, were indeed very ſevere Judgments of God, and made great deſolation among men; but they were far from making any ſuch Epidemical Devaſtation, as is here ſuppoſed, that they did not ſo much as overpoiſe the gradual Increaſe of one Generation. The Ancient Hiſtories are not ſo very punctual, to let us make a Demonſtrative proof of this, but yet from theſe we may gather arguments enough, to convince you of the unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonableneſs of this your ſuppoſition. For what ſignified that great Plague
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:42179:51"/>
in one City, and a few neighbouring territories, to the mighty Increaſe of People, from <hi>Cadmus</hi> his time? We find by <hi>Thucydides</hi> his Hiſtory, that the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians</hi> carried on the <hi>Pelponneſian</hi> War vigorouſly, for all that;<note place="margin">Remarks upon the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Peſtilences.</note> that they were far more annoyed by the yearly incurſions of the <hi>Spartans</hi> into <hi>Attica;</hi> and probably had as many Men loſt, as by the Plague, which laſted but a ſhort time; but their War continued ſeven and twenty years. We have no particular account, what number died of that Plague, or what proportion of the People it ſwept away. It is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, the Army ſuffered moſt when it was infected; becauſe of their hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare and lodging, and lack of Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance and Conveniencies.<note place="margin">Thucrá. Hiſt. Li. <hi>2.</hi>
                     </note> And <hi>Thu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cydides</hi> gives us a particular account, what proportion of that died by the Infection. For the Army under <hi>Agnon</hi> and <hi>Theopompus,</hi> which took Infection at the Siege of <hi>Potidaea</hi> was in all 4300; whereof 1500 died of the Plague, which is but about a third part; and we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſuppoſe, that of the Citizens, who had better care taken of them, there died half ſo many. So that Plague ſo rare as this was, and ſo remarkable to
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:42179:52"/>
all Ages, cutting off no greater a number of Men, in ſo ſmall a Circuit, could tend little to our Univerſal De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſtation. Indeed the Plague in the ſixth Century, which was called the <hi>Lues Inguinaria,</hi> or the <hi>ſwelling in the Groin,</hi> was more Epidemical and of longer Continuance, for it laſted fifty years,<note place="margin">Evang. Hiſt. Eccl.</note> and ſwept away multitudes of People, all over the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire; and yet Mankind was very inconſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably leſſened by it, as appears by the ſwarming Incurſions of <hi>Hunns, Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bards, Saxons, Saracens,</hi> &amp;c. in diverſe parts of the World, about that time. As for our late Plague in <hi>London,</hi> we are able to make more particular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks upon that. There died in that dreadful Viſitation according to the weekly accounts of the Plague, in the years 1665 and 1666. 70,544. Now the number of inhabitants at that time were about 510,000; for the common bills of mortality, at that time, were yearly 17000 (ſince, by the Increaſe of the City; they are come to three or four and twenty thouſand) which multiplyed by 30 years, the middle Computation of Life, gives the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid 510,000. of which the 70,544
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:42179:52"/>
which died, is about an eighth part. Now <hi>London</hi> has been a place, that has been mightily ſubject to Plagues, and if we conſult our Hiſtories we ſhall find one there once in about five and twenty years, tho' perhaps none ſo prodigiouſly ſweeping as this laſt; but granting them all like this to take away the eighth part of the Inhabitants, once in 25 years; let us ſee what this will do, towards hindring the Increaſe of Mankind.<note place="margin">Eſſay of the Multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Mankind.</note> Sir <hi>William Petty</hi> has very handſomly proved, that Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind doubles it ſelf once in 360 years. Now 25 being found 14 times in 360 the City of <hi>London</hi> muſt every five and twenty years (the Period of the Plague) increaſe a 14th part; but then the Plague cuts off an eight part, which is a great deal more than it gains; but then that 14th part helps very conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derably to make up the loſs. But when on the other ſide, we conſider the whole Country of <hi>England</hi> to contain ten times as many People as the City, the Increaſe of the whole Nation, in five and twenty years, will be a 14th part compleat (as being free from thoſe Plagues) and in 360 years will abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely double; ſo that here will be this
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:42179:53"/>
prodigious Increaſe of ten parts of the Nation, and the inconſiderable De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of but one, which is ſupplied by all the reſt. So that the whole Nation lacks but 3/7 of 1/11 (which is not a twentieth part) of doubling in the 360 years. And pray now, Sir, what are the Plagues of <hi>London,</hi> to this Aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation? What is this inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble loſs of one part, to the gain of all the reſt? I am ſure, Sir, if you were a Trader, you would look upon this as conſiderable improvement, to have your Gains twenty, and your Loſſes but one.</p>

                  <p>Indeed, Sir, I think your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation may be pretty exact; and now be pleaſed to ſee, what horrible work this Computation and your doubling Period will make together. Suppoſe you go backwards nine of your Periods of 360 years reckoning this year to be in the World 960 millions; 360 years before this <hi>viz. A. D.</hi> 1335. 480 mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions; 360 years before that <hi>A. D.</hi> 975. 240 millions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the ninth Period will fall upon the year of the World 1404. not long before the return of the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> from <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and then there were in the World accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this Computation, 3 millions ſeven hundred and fifty thouſand, which does but very ill agree with your
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:42179:54"/>
Book of Numbers. For <hi>Moſes Numb.</hi> 12.32. reckons of all the Tribes of the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that were able to bear Arms, 603, 550, to which if we add the old Men, the Women and the Children, they will trebble the number, ſo as to make 1, 810, 650; which is almoſt half the number of the People then in the World, <hi>viz.</hi> 3, 750. 000, which it is pretty ſtrange, that a parcel of Fugitives out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable a Corner of the World, ſhould do. Beſides, let us run back two Periods farther, and then we ſhall come within twenty or thirty years of the Deluge, ſo that then there muſt be in the World nine hundred thirty ſeven thouſand five hundred; a good round Company of <hi>Noah</hi>'s Grandchildren, all to be born in nine and twenty years at the moſt. I will not teize you any further, to find out Armies for <hi>Belus</hi> and <hi>Ninus,</hi> ſo nigh the Flood; for upon this computation, I am confident you will be hard put to it, to do it for <hi>Xerxes</hi> and <hi>Hannibal.</hi>

                  <p>Sir,<note place="margin">The World increaſed more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly than now.</note> You go now upon a very great miſtake, as if I aſſerted that 360 years was the common Period of Dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blings; for the increaſe of the World,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:42179:55"/>
for all Ages of it. It is plain from Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, that the increaſe proceeds ſlower now than it did formerly. <hi>Greece</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed more between the <hi>Trojan</hi> and the <hi>Peloponneſian</hi> War, than it has done ſince.

                  <p>This is not, Sir, an empty Hypotheſis, but a neceſſary Truth to confute the Calumnies of Unbelievers againſt the Moſaical Books;<note place="margin">This pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture and Reaſon.</note> which is not only conſonant to the tenour of thoſe Writings themſelves, but to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience and good reaſoning. There was a peculiar Bleſſing of Increaſe given to thoſe firſt Ages after the Flood. <hi>God Bleſſed</hi> Noah <hi>and his Sons, and ſaid unto them be Fruitful and Multiply, and Repleniſh the Earth,</hi> Gen. 9.1. And therefore we Chriſtians, who acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the Authority of Divine Writ, are bound to believe this bleſſing took effect. Beſides this is agreeable to all the reaſon in the World, that the firſt Ages ſhould be moſt prolifick, the World being to be ſtocked by a few Perſons: For the World lay waſt, till there were a conſiderable number of Inhabitants born to cultivate it; Men wanted ſufficient Aſſociates and Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, and the benefit of mutual kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:42179:56"/>
and Artifices; but when Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind arrived to a competent frequency, when the Earth was divided into di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Proprieties, and Men were of ſufficient number to be ſerviceable to one another, there was not ſuch need of a multitudinous Production as was before; and therefore, as the World was more Peopled, the Increaſe did proportionably ſlacken. Beſides if the World had kept on its former Increaſe without abatement, the Earth muſt have been over-ſtocked before this time, or at leaſt before the time which God had allotted for it. Your inſtances of Famines, Wars, and Deluges are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſertions without proof, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſhall forbear ſpeaking to them; eſpecially ſince we find they have done no great miſchief to the increaſe of Mankind, as far as Hiſtory goes.</p>

If the World was from Eternity, you muſt needs make them an Eternal Race of the moſt ſtupid Blockheads imaginable,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:42179:56"/>
without the leaſt dram almoſt of Wit, or Contrivance, or indeed common Senſe; and that none of theſe qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ever were known in the World, till within theſe two or three thouſand years laſt paſt. For there is hardly any uſeful Art or Science, but we know its Original and Progreſs, and its firſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venter, or at leaſt its firſt Introducer into ſuch a part of the World; which were abſolutely impoſſible to do, if there had been Eternal Inhabitants there. For who can imagine, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt an infinity of Rational Men, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſo many Millions of hints and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities, none ſhould, before theſe laſt Ages, have lighted upon thoſe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Arts, which it was ſo uneaſy to be without, and were ſo eaſy and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to be found? Could the World, or at leaſt <hi>Greece,</hi> be from all Eternity without the common Tools of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penter, the Saw, the Augre, the Plain, and the Plumb Line, till <hi>Daedalus</hi> had the happineſs to invent them?

thoſe of Wine and Honey, till <hi>Bacchus</hi> ſhew'd them to the World? Should no one know how to cut and poliſh Stone till <hi>Cadmus</hi> taught it? How ſhould the Art of Dialling be ſo late found out, to mention nothing of Clocks and Watches? The <hi>Romans</hi> had not ſo much as a Sun-Dial, till the ſecond <hi>Punick</hi> War, and when they had one, they were forced to make uſe of that alone,<note place="margin">Plin. Nat. Hiſt.

                  <p>

What unhappy Men were thoſe Eternal Inhabitants, to have all their actions forgot, whilſt Hiſtory is crowed up with ſo many minute in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>confiderable Actions, which have been done in a few Ages laſt paſt? How ſhould it come to paſs, that only in ſo many Myriads of Ages, <hi>Greece</hi> it ſelf ſhould have afforded us nothing of Hiſtory but a little Poetick Banter, 'till the time of <hi>Herodotus</hi> and <hi>Thucy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dides?</hi> That <hi>Egypt,</hi> the School of <hi>Greece,</hi> not long before knew nothing, but a ſilly Hyperbolical Chronology, and ſome Myſtical Hieroglyphicks; This is ſo ſtrangely inconſiſtent with your pretended Eternity of the World, that it affords moſt evident marks of the lateneſs of it.</p>

                  <p>Your Argument from the late Invention of vulgar Arts is not ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive as you would make it: For
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:42179:58"/>
thoſe Arts which are ſuppoſed to be invented in theſe laſt times, were in all probability only revived after a long time of diſuſe, or they might have ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times been loſt, and as many times re-invented. Juſt as Painting in Glaſs has been loſt for an Age or two, and now is by ſome Artificers, as is reported, regained in its ancient per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. So we have loſt the Art of making Napkins which would burn off their Soil in the Fire inſtead of waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, made of the famous <hi>Asbeſtos,</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by <hi>Pliny.

Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we know well enough the reaſon, why Hiſtory deſcribes but a few of thoſe innumerable Ages to us; which is, becauſe the uſe of Letters is but a late Invention, and therefore it is no wonder, that Men ſhould not write Hiſtories when they could not write at all. Had but the Inhabitants of the World, in thoſe laſt Ages, been ſo happy as to have found out writing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the World would have been fill'd with Hiſtory and Chronology; we ſhould have had <hi>Aera's</hi> upon <hi>Aera's</hi> for thouſands of years, even beyond your <hi>Julian</hi> period; nay your whole Epoche <hi>ab An.

                  <p>I will agree with you, Sir,<note place="margin">No conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Arts loſt and revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved again.</note> that ſeveral Arts in the World have been loſt, and others after a time again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:42179:59"/>
but then theſe have been ſuch Arts as have been more curious than uſeful, and have rather been Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental, than Beneficial to Mankind; and there has been ſome good reaſon to be given of their diſuſe, either by their growing out of faſhion, or by ſome more eaſy and commodious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention. Thus the Art of Glaſs-paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was loſt, about the time of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, when the Images of Saints were not ſo highly eſteemed, and Churches began to be more gravely adorned. Thus the uſe of Archers in an Army has been laid aſide, ſince the Invention of Pikes and Guns. But who can imagine, that the Art of the Smith and the Carpenter ſhould ever be forgot after the firſt Invention; unleſs we could ſuppoſe that Houſes and all ſorts of Utenſils and Conveniences ſhould grow out of faſhion, and it ſhould be the mode for Men to live like Colts and Wild Aſſes. Unleſs Men could be ſuppoſed, to forget the uſe of Eating and Drinking, I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident they could never forget the Art of Ploughing and Sowing, and Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Grape.</p>

I look upon the Invention of Writing, or Letters, to be one of the moſt happy and noble Inventions which ever the World was bleſſed with; and the Perſon, who ever he were, that firſt lighted upon this admirable Art, I look upon, to have been a Man of a peculiar Genius and Wit, and to have made more Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation than all that had gone before him in ſome Ages. But then I look upon it next to impoſſible, that Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind ſhould have continued from all Eternity without the Invention of Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, be it never ſo happy, or if you pleaſe ſo fortuitous an Invention: For if the World be Eternal, all things muſt be as they are now, I mean Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind muſt have been as ſagacious an Animal as it is now, and as capable of finding out and improving Inventions; and if ſo, there being in an Eternity of time all manner of poſſible combinations of matter, and caſual hit of Accidents which are the ground of all Inventions, no Art could poſſibly be uninvented in
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:42179:60"/>
all that time. So that if the Art of Writing were never ſo caſual an Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, there muſt millions of millions of hints be given for it, in all that time; but to ſay Mankind, all that while, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver took notice of them, is to make them, inſtead of the moſt ſagacious, to be the moſt ſtupid Animals in the World. Which you will better aſſent to, when you conſider that the Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Letters is not ſo much a fortui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous hit, as a Natural Deduction of good Reaſoning. And, if you pleaſe, I will enlarge upon this ſomething more than ordinary; becauſe I find, your Theiſts uſe to be mighty trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant upon this Argument.</p>
                  <p>I take Writing only to be a ſpecies of Painting or Imagery; and the <hi>Greeks</hi> very well expreſs them both by the word <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>.<note place="margin">The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs in the Art of Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and the no Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Difficulty in its In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention.</note> For as Painting or Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery is a Repreſentation of <hi>Shapes</hi> and <hi>Actions,</hi> ſo Writing is a Repreſentation of <hi>Words.</hi> Now theſe things are all that are naturally to be repreſented of Mankind, by outward Delineations, and the latter ſtill is more difficult than the former. The firſt Eſſay of Imagery was in all probability the ſimple ſhapes of Men, Beaſts, Flowers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by a
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:42179:60"/>
rude and imperfect Delineation, or Sculpture, either in a Plane, which the Greeks call Sciography, or a ſolid which we generally call Carving. The next Progreſs was to repreſent the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Body, as a Man running, Striking, Walking, Kneeling, and of this, among the Greeks, <hi>Daedalus</hi> is reported to be the Author; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him Statues were made with Hands falling down by the ſides, with Eyes ſhut, with Legs and Feet joyned in the nature of Pillars rather than Statues. Hence came the <hi>Aera ſpirantia,</hi> and the <hi>Animare figuras,</hi> &amp;c. in the Poets Deſcriptions of <hi>Daedalus.</hi> The next and moſt ſublime Progreſs in the <hi>Graphical</hi> Art was to repreſent Words, which we call <hi>Writing.</hi> And this ſort of repreſentation was much more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult than the reſt. For this was a Repreſentation of an Image, or the Picture of another Repreſentative; for as Letters are the Repreſentation of Words, ſo Words are the Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Thoughts; and therefore it was a matter of greater difficulty, and required more niceneſs and exactneſs to carry on the Imagery upon the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection. But this was not all, Shapes
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:42179:61"/>
and Actions were to be ſeen by the Eye, and therefore their Images being paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed were eaſily diſcerned by the ſame faculty. But words were things to be heard and not to be ſeen, and therefore it was far more difficult to <hi>paint</hi> them. They therefore, that made the firſt Eſſay to <hi>paint</hi> or <hi>write</hi> words, muſt needs find it a very diſcouraging Task, to find figures or marks for ſo many thouſand words in a Language; that would be too hard for Invention, and too troubleſome for Memory. The Ingenious therefore firſt found out the Heroglyphical way of writing, which did repreſent whole ſentences, as a Crowned Lion did repreſent a Bold, ſtrong Victorious King, a Fox a Cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning one; an Aſs did denote ſervitude, and a Sheep folly. To theſe when there were added ſome few notes for common terms of acting, ſuch as giving, taking, buying, ſelling, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and this was the ſum and <hi>acme</hi> of the Hieraglyphical way of writing. Now this was a way of writing very troubleſome and uncertain; for the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures and marks muſt needs be very numerous, and yet not repreſent one quarter of the words in a Language,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:42179:61"/>
and therefore conſequently very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to be unlocked. The only way therefore to get rid of this trouble, was to invent a few marks which might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent all manner of words. And this was not very difficult to be attempted by thoſe, who had made any Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon the nature of words. For ſuch could eaſily determine, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though words were never ſo numerous, yet the Elementary parts which did compoſe them were but few. They might ſoon perceive that all words were but four or five ſounds diverſly modulated by the Organs of the Mouth and Throat. The five Vowels are far eaſier to be diſtinguiſhed than the notes in Muſick; and the Conſonants are not much more difficult. In the word <hi>A-mo,</hi> any one way perceive the firſt Syllable is only a clear plain ſound of the Breath through the Mouth; and <hi>mo</hi> is only a hollow ſound modulated by the Lips. <hi>Amor</hi> is a ſound made by the ſame Organs, with a regurgitation of the laſt Vocal ſound to the Throat. From hence an ingenious perſon may obſerve, that by the modulation of theſe ſounds fourteen or fifteen ways, by the repeating or tranſpoſing them all
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:42179:62"/>
manner of words are made. And then he may very well conclude (when he has ſufficiently diſtinguiſhed theſe ſounds and modulations) that by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying particular Marks or [Letters] to each of theſe, he may repreſent all manner of words, or write what he will with thoſe few Characters. And I doubt not but this, or ſomething very like, was the reaſoning of that admirable Perſon who firſt thought upon this noble Art. Indeed it is far eaſier to run along with this thread of Thought after the Invention than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; but to ſay that amongſt ſo many Millions of Ingenious Men in millions of Ages, no one ſhould ever have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned after this manner, or have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted this hint ſucceſsfully, is a thing ſo very incredible, that we Chriſtians have not Faith to believe. And this is all I have to ſay to you about the Eternity of the World; ſo that now I am ready for your other exceptions, if you have no more to reply upon this Head.</p>

                  <p>I think we have bandied this ſubject about long enough, and I thank you kindly for your Arguments, which as you have urged them have had that
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:42179:62"/>
force upon me as to make me abandon my former Opinion of the World's E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, which indeed I never before thought ſo abſurd as you have made it. But ſtill, my dear Friend, I have ſome dregs of a Doubt behind, whether it may not be many thouſand of years, or perhaps Ages, older than you look upon it to be, if you go upon the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaical account. For if we look into the ancient computations of other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions beſides the Jews, we ſhall find prodigious accounts of Time. For <hi>Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liger</hi> (in his Book <hi>de Emendat. Temp.</hi>) ſays, that then (<hi>A. D.</hi> 1594.<note place="margin">

                     <hi>Bramins</hi> of <hi>Gauzrat</hi> ſaid, that in the years 1639. there had paſſed 326669 Ages. To this if we add the exceſſive computations of the <hi>Egyptians</hi> and <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daeans,</hi> and the Inſcriptions of Ancient Marbles in ſome ancient Language which is now forgot, we cannot in any probability allot the World ſo late an Original as the Moſaical account does.</p>

                  <p>The Argument I urged before from the Increaſe of Mankind is good againſt theſe exceſſive Computations,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:42179:63"/>
as it is againſt the Eternity of the World;<note place="margin">Exceſſive Computati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons no Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of the Eternity of the World.</note> for granting the World ſo old as is here pretended, it would have been over-peopled long before now, as much as it would have been in an Eternity. So that if you allow the Cogency of the Argument in one caſe, you muſt like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in the other. But beſides, the pure aſſertions of Nations as to their Antiquity, without good Hiſtory to ſupport them, have always been very little regarded; becauſe it has been a conſtant Vanity in all Nations, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear as old as they could. Hence the Inhabitants of every Country endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured what they were able, to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed <gap reason="foreign">

And with how great a Zeal Nations have carried this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, we may make an Eſtimate of, by that pleaſant contention of the <hi>Scythi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> and <hi>Aegyptians</hi> in the ſecond Book of <hi>Juſtin.</hi> As for the <hi>Aegyptians, Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus Siculus</hi> who lived among them, interprets their vaſt accounts of time by Months or Lunary years; and ſo may the other be eſteemed if there be any truth in them at all. As for your old Inſcriptions, ſuch as that which they

tell us is to be ſeen at <hi>Caxumo</hi> in <hi>Aethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pia;</hi> that is eaſily to be accounted for, by the great alteration of Kingdoms and Languages.

For though your Arguments have convinced me of a temporary production of the World, and that God ſome time or other, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps not many thouſand years ago, did make it; yet I can never believe it was made in that ſort he would have it. For he makes the whole Univerſe as well as this World, or Earth of ours, to be made at the ſame time; as if thoſe prodigious Bodies of the Stars, and all the innumerable furniture of thoſe infinite ſpaces, were made only to ſpangle round this little ſpeck of ours. He begins with a <hi>in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth;</hi>
                     <pb n="97" facs="tcp:42179:64"/>
as if the Heaven bore any proportion to this little poor Earthy Atom. And again <hi>God made two great Lights,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>he made the Stars alſo;</hi> bringing in thoſe innumerable prodigious Bodies, with a poor <hi>alſo,</hi> which are millions of times bigger than all the reſt of the Creation. No, Sir, I have much more auguſt conceptions of the Deity than to think he made ſuch numerous and glorious Productions to dance attendance to ſuch a puny point. For I look upon God to be a Being of infinite Power and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs (eſpecially) as well as Duration; and therefore I cannot ſuppoſe he ſhould lie ſnug within his own happineſs from all Eternity, and never diſplay a vein of his good nature and communicative kindneſs till within a few thouſand years laſt paſt. That Men ſhould have ſuch abject and narrow-ſpirited thoughts of ſo diffuſive a goodneſs, rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in me ſuch a tranſport of Paſſion or Zeal, or what you pleaſe to call it; that the names of Atheiſtical, Hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, Papiſtical, and a hundred others, which your Folks are ſcar'd at, don't ſeem to me half ſo impious and reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the Deity as this one Hetero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxy.</p>

But you ſhould not be too outragious at the Sacred Prophet, for a matter it is hard to prove him guilty of. For I look upon this his Hiſtory of the Creation, to be the moſt noble piece of Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, which ever the World was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with, and whenever there appear any blemiſhes in it, it is only the ſully it has contracted from bad In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters. I confeſs the generality of Divines, both Ancient and Modern, have thought the whole Univerſe was created in the Hexaemeron; becauſe God is ſaid to have then created <hi>the Heaven and the Earth,</hi> and becauſe the Stars are mentioned in the fourth days work. This Opinion has given indeed mighty advantage to Atheiſtical Men, eſpecially thoſe who had any taſt of Philoſophy, and had conſidered what a little pittance of the Univerſe this Earth of ours was, for the ſake of which all things ſeem'd, by this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, to be framed at the ſame time; nay this point is ſuppoſed, to have bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied the Deity, more than all the reſt. Now I ſhall take off the force of this
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:42179:65"/>
prejudice when I ſhall have proved, that <hi>Moſes</hi> does not aſſert the Stars to be any part of the Adamical Creation; but that in all probability that Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was not extended beyond the Sun and the Planets.<note place="margin">The fixed Stars pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably no part of the Moſaick Creation.</note> As for the firſt Verſe in <hi>Geneſis,</hi> where God is ſaid to have created <hi>the Heaven and the Earth;</hi> it is plain that frequently in Scripture Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage the word Heaven does not ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify more than the Regions of the Air, as when in the 20. <hi>v.</hi> of this Chapter, the Fowls are ſaid to <hi>fly in the Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Heaven.</hi> The Windows of Heaven, Gen. 7.11. <hi>The Bottles of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> Job 38.37. <hi>(i. e.)</hi> the <hi>Clouds;</hi> The <hi>hoary froſt of Heaven,</hi> Job 38.29. and in a hundred other places; where <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> can be extended no further than the Air. So that when God is ſaid here to create the Heaven and the Earth, we cannot from hence conclude, that he then created every thing in the vaſt extramundane ſpaces; though the vulgar do ſometimes call all this, by the name of Heaven. But this is not the knot of the Difficulty, the greateſt ſtreſs of the Objection lies upon the 16 <hi>Verſe,</hi> where, among other parts of the Creation, God is poſitively ſaid to have
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:42179:66"/>
made the Stars. <hi>And God made two great Lights the greater Light to rule the Day, and the leſſer Light to rule the Night: he made the Stars alſo,</hi>

                     </note> Gen. 3.16. But the Text does not neceſſarily denote ſo much. Our Engliſh Tranſlation inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polates the words [he made] which are not in the original; for the ſimple Tranſlation of the Hebrew is only this. <hi>And God made two great Lights, the greater Light to rule the Day, and the leſſer Light to rule the Night, and the Stars.</hi> So that here the word <hi>Stars</hi> ſeems to come in ſo very abruptly, and by the bye, that one would be apt to think, that it was clapt in by ſomebody elſe, after <hi>Moſes</hi> his time, who had a mind to be mend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Hypotheſis; or elſe was added as a marginal note by ſome Rabbi, and ſo at length crept into the Text, as Father <hi>Simon</hi> has proved ſeveral o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have done. And there might be the more countenance for this, when the Jews found themſelves, to have been ſo horribly plagued, for worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the Hoſt of Heaven for Gods, when they were Creatures, tho' at the ſame time they could not find any account of their Creation among the other parts of the Univerſe. This might be to
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:42179:66"/>
afford a Covert to ſuch Idolaters, who might from hence infer the Stars to be uncreated Beings, which was fairly taken way, by adding ſuch a Gloſs in the Margin, or by taking it from thence into the Text, where the Tranſcriber could not think it reaſonable it ſhould be omitted. Now this is no very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable account, to any one who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders, how much by head and ſhould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers <hi>and the Stars</hi> comes in; if we take the common Interpretation of the words. But I think we may give a better Interpretation of them, and that is this. The words <hi>and the Stars</hi> are not to be referred to the word <hi>made</hi> in the beginning of the Verſe, but to the word <hi>Rule</hi> which immediately goes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and are to be coupled not with the Sun and Moon, but the night. <hi>The leſſer Light to rule the Night and the Stars.</hi> Whereby is denoted the pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar uſefulneſs and predominancy of the Moon, above all other Stars and Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, in this Earth of ours. For this ſhines out when they do but twinkle, and affords a mighty influence in the production and growth of all Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles. So that upon this account, ſhe may very well be called the Ruler of
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:42179:67"/>
the Night, and as it were <hi>Prince</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Stars. For as it appears to us, it is a glorious Planet and a Princely Light; and it is no abſurdity in the divine Legiſlator (as ſome will have it) in the literal ſenſe to call it a <hi>Great Light.</hi>

                  <p>The next thing which diſlikes me in the Moſaical account, is this. That he makes Light before the Sun, which is a monſtrous abſurdity: For the firſt thing which he makes the Deity do, is to give out his <hi>Fiat</hi> for Light; upon this notable contrivance

The Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins who are uſed to be very fruitful for Invention, tell us the Sun was crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the firſt day, when the Light is ſaid to be Created, but is mentioned by way of repetition in the fourth Day. Others will have this Light to be a Lucid Cloud, like that which went before the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and moved round the World like the Sun, till that was created. But our Prophet need not be holp off with ſuch
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:42179:70"/>
ſilly ſhifts as theſe: You know that <hi>Darkneſs</hi> has been in all Ages the chief Idea Men have had of a <hi>Chaos.</hi> Hence <hi>Nox,</hi> and <hi>Erebus,</hi> and <hi>Tartarus</hi> have been the principal part of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of it in the Poets and Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers. Therefore it ſhould ſeem very agreeable to the Reaſon of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, that the firſt remove from the <hi>Chaos</hi> ſhould be a tendency to <hi>Light.</hi> Either all Mankind have been out in their notion of a <hi>Chaos,</hi> or the Moſaick Hypotheſis is very well contrived, to be ſo conformable to it. But by Light, as it was produced the firſt day, muſt not be underſtood the darting of Rays from a luminous Body, or the trepida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Intermediate Corpuſcles between that and the Eye, which is the actual Light we enjoy now: But only the forming and adapting ſuch tenuious parts in ſuch a figure and manner, as when ſuch a Luminous Body ſhould be afterwards created they ſhould convey Light to us, or raiſe that agreeable ſenſation in us. Which I will the better explain to you by this Scheme, which I deſire your favour to look upon. It is my Opinion that upon the firſt formation,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:42179:71"/>
the whole ſpace of the <hi>Magnus Orbis,</hi> which is all that ſpace which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended within the circle which <hi>Saturn</hi> deſcribes about the Sun, was the Bounds of the Chaos. For the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Planets, <hi>Jupiter, Mars,</hi> &amp;c. which are contained within this Circle, bear ſo many ſimilitudes and relations one to the other and to our Earth, have the ſame common Luminary, the ſame Center, alike form and gravity, with many other Affections, which may be demonſtrated of them, that to any reaſonable Man they ſeem to be the production of one Creation. If the Sun was not created till your Creation, as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſays poſitively it was not, we cannot imagine that all the other Planets, till that was created, went rowling all in the dark round an ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary point, to no purpoſe. We muſt therefore aſſign them all one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon time of Creation, which muſt be the Moſaical. The Chaos there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt be of equal extent to the Creation, that is to take up all the Room within the aforeſaid Circle. Now it ſeems moſt agreeable to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that this Chaolick matter was then firſt created out of nothing by

God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.3. compared with 2 <hi>Mac.</hi> 7.28. That Original Creation therefore is repreſented in the Figure I. Wherein is comprehended all the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in this ſolar World unformed and indigeſted, without Light or Motion. Either the matter was not broke and attenuated, into thoſe fine Corpuſcles, which compoſe Light, or elſe they lay irretited and entangled with the parts of diſſimilar groſs Subſtances mixed with them; ſo as to make the whole Expanſion reſemble a Great Dark Muddy Globe. So that by its opakeneſs it hindred the Light of the Stars, or any Luminous Body, from paſſing through it. In this Condition, I ſuppoſe, the Chaos to have ſtood, when the <hi>Fiat</hi> for Light was given. And then when the Divine Spirit, or the Wind of God made its <hi>Incubation,</hi> or motion upon the Abyſs, all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed ſtagnating principles of matter began to range into order and form; the dull, heavy terreous parts, which over-clouded the <hi>Expanſum,</hi> had their ſummons to retire to their reſpective Centres; and they preſently obeyed the Almighty Orders, and part thereof ſubſide to the Center of the <hi>Earth,</hi>

ſome to <hi>Jupiter,</hi> ſome to <hi>Saturn,</hi> and others to <hi>Venus,</hi> &amp;c. till the Globes of thoſe reſpective Planets were compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and till the whole <hi>Expanſum</hi> was cleared of theſe groſs and opake parts of matter, and of a muddy dark Chaos, became a Tenuious, Pellucid Globe.

pleaſes. Doth this look like Inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, or indeed like common ſenſe. And yet we find a whole day attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, to this Imaginary work. Indeed it ſometimes makes me laugh to think, how the poor Interpreters ſweat, under this Difficulty. Some place theſe ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per-celeſtial Waters only in the Clouds, but then they know not how to get them thither; for as yet there was no Sun to exhale them. Others carry them as high as the Celeſtial Orbs, and make uſe of them there, for refrigerating the heat of the Sun, and Moon; for fear they ſhould melt the ſolid Orbs. Thus <hi>Theodoret</hi> and <hi>Procopius,</hi> two very learned Men. <hi>Bede</hi> will have them there, to keep the heat of the Sun from being too intenſe, and ſcorching us too much. But <hi>Cornelius à Lapide,</hi> has found out a moſt admirable uſe for them, which is this; to make Canals and Waterworks, for the Bleſſed in the <hi>Empyrean</hi> Heaven. <hi>

                  <p>Your prejudices tranſport you too far, <hi>Philologus;</hi> and Gentlemen of your perſuaſion are too haſty, when they go about to diſpute that out of the World which they cannot aſſign the uſe of.<note place="margin">Waters above the Firmament the Waters of the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets.</note> There are a many Plants and Druggs in the World, which we do not know the uſe of, and yet it would be a madneſs to deny their Exiſtence. If by Gods word we are aſſured, there are ſuch Celeſtial Waters, it is to no purpoſe to diſpute the uſe of them; for tho' we do not know it, God may. But perhaps there may be another ſenſe of the words, than what is uſually ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended. <hi>And God made the Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and divided the Waters, which were under the Firmament from the Waters which were above the Firmament.</hi> v. 7. Now by the Firmament is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, and I think very well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, the Atmoſphere of the Earth, or the Regions of the Air. All the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:42179:75"/>
is, to find out what theſe Coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial Water or Waters above the Air be. Now there is no need to ſeek out Pools in the <hi>Empyreum;</hi> if we can find Waters nigher home. Then, tell me, Sir, why may not the Waters which belong to each Planet be theſe Waters above the Firmament? That the Moon has Waters analogous to our Seas is demonſtrable from the diverſe Reflexion of Light from her different parts, nay from the very ſhape of Seas and Iſlands we obſerve in her: and that the other Planets have the ſame, is highly probable from their ſimilitude to one another. Now I ſuppoſe, that before the Work of the ſecond Day, all this Planetary Water lay undiſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably diſperſed throughout the <hi>Expan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum,</hi> and together with the <hi>Aether,</hi> made up that Pellucid Globe; which was left by the ſeceſſion of the opake and terreous parts, that ſubſided to the ſeven reſpective Centres and formed the Bodies of the Planets. The work therefore of the ſecond Day was, to make a Diviſion of theſe Waters, to diſtribute them in proper proportions to the ſeveral Planets: and in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to God's command, all the Aqueous
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:42179:76"/>
parts of the Great Pellucid ſubſided to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Centres of the Planets, and were circumfuſed about their Globes. Thus the <hi>Expanſum</hi> was cleared off a ſecond time by the ſubſidency of the Aqueous and uninflammable parts; and left the Pellucid to conſiſt of a ſtill finer and purer ſubſtance, as you ſee deſcribed in the Figure III. Now this ſubſidency of the Aqueous parts to the different Centres <hi>Moſes</hi> calls <hi>dividing the Waters under the Firmament from the Waters which are above the Firmament.</hi> The Waters under the Firmament are the Waters of the Earth, the Waters above the Firmament are thoſe of the Moon and other Planets, which ſince the ſecond days work are diſtinguiſhed, but lay confuſedly diſperſed in the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panſum</hi> before.</p>

                  <p>I proteſt, Sir, I am very well pleaſed with this Explication of yours; this has engaged me to have a better Opinion of the Moſaick Hypotheſis, than ever I had in my Life; for it now ſeems to have ſomething of Reaſon and Philoſophy in it. But ſtill there ſeem to be ſome Difficulties in this third days Work. For it is not eaſy to conceive, how all the Channels of the Seas ſhould
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:42179:76"/>
be hollowed out in one days time, or what ſhould be done with the Earth which was digged out of thoſe hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.<note place="margin">O. R. <hi>P.</hi>
                     </note> It ſhould ſeem to require more than one days time, for the Waters which covered the moſt inland Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries to run off from thence into thoſe Oceanal Channels. Pray, Sir, how do you get over theſe Difficulties?</p>
               </sp>

                  <p>This is, Sir,<note place="margin">The Seas eaſily formed in one Day.</note> 
                     <hi>in Scirpo nodum quaerere,</hi> to raiſe doubts where there is not the leaſt appearance of any: For what a mighty difficulty is it for God Almighty to hollow out the Channels of the Seas in one Day? If you and I were to get Workmen to do it in ſuch a time it would be a very difficult En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize. But for God-Almighty to do that in four and twenty Hours time, by an Almighty Power, which he might, if he had pleaſed, have done in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, is ſuch a wonder as no wiſe man ſhould be ſtartled at. You ſee here this little bit of Earth which I take out of this border, I can in a minutes time mould it into what form I will; I can make it round or oval, convex or hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, or how I pleaſe, and may not we very well ſuppoſe, that God-Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty might, in as little time, have
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:42179:77"/>
formed Earth into what Figure he pleaſed. The Earth was then very flexible, its parts being not then ſetled into its preſent hardneſs, and therefore might eaſily be moulded into any Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure whatſoever. But to wonder how God could bring the Waters which co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the Inland Countries in one days time into the Channel of the Sea, is to me very ſtrange: For why ſhould God in his Creation be tied to the dull ſlug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſh motion of his Creatures, ſince Motion is demonſtrated to be infinitely faſt or ſlow, as God pleaſes? And why ſhould we oblige him in his works to any determinate degree of it? We ſee the Waters move juſt ſuch a pace now, and therefore God muſt neceſſarily for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth wait their motions, and protract the time of his Creation becauſe of that. This I am ſure is ſomething of the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy of a <hi>Country-man</hi> as you call it: This is a true <hi>Plebeian Hypotheſis,</hi> and ſomething of Kin to that of <hi>Horace.</hi>

                  <p>Pray, Sir, have a care of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting; for you are not got ſo clear off from this days Work yet. I am afraid
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:42179:77"/>
you will have a deadly rub in your way, when I ſhall ask you, if it be not a little inconſiſtent in the Moſaick Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, to make the Trees and Herbs before the Sun? Upon this Hypotheſis we may very well expect to find Orange Trees and Melons in <hi>Greenland,</hi> when all manner of Plants could grow where there never had been any Sun at all. Your Prophet had been a better Bota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſt, if he had but contriv'd to have poſt-poned his Herbage for one day at leaſt, for then the Sun might have brought them out thick and threefold; but for this cold, dark, watry ground to be ſo prodigiouſly prolifick, is ſo ſtrangely unnatural, that methinks you ſhould be aſhamed to think of it.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Cred.</speaker>
                  <p>I wonder, Sir,<note place="margin">Trees and Plants might eaſily grow be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Sun was made.</note> you ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, or talk of nature in the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for God was then <hi>producing</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and not acting according to it. He was then forming thoſe Laws and Methods of Nature, but he could not be ſuppoſed to act by them, before he had formed them. But nevertheleſs, what unnaturalneſs I pray was there in creating Plants before the Sun? If they had been created ſome years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it, there would have been ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:42179:78"/>
in the Objection; but all this time was but one poor day. Now few Plants are ſo tender, but they will live as long a time as that, without either <hi>Sun,</hi> or <hi>Water,</hi> or <hi>Earth.</hi> But theſe, being formed in the Earth the third day, cannot be ſuppoſed to have died before the fourth, when the Sun began to ſhine upon them. But I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not imagine what need there ſhould be of the Sun for the Creation of Plants. Indeed there is very great need of it in the natural production of them, to open the Fibres, to elevate the Juices, to unfold the Coats and Leaves of the Embryon Plant in the ſeed. But here were no precedent Coats and Leaves to be unfolded, for God then formed the Plants immediately out of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Matter, ſo that the ſeed was the production of thoſe firſt Plants and not the Parent of them. <hi>And God ſaid let the Earth bring forth Graſs and Herb, yielding ſeed after his kind, and the Tree yielding Fruit, whoſe ſeed was in it ſelf, after his kind,</hi> Gen. 1.12. But grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a vital warmth ſhould be requiſite, for the production of theſe primitive Plants; it could not be wanting in the new Earth: For the Terreous parts
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:42179:78"/>
of matter having been agitated in the Chaos, by ſuch a rapid motion, and having ſubſided to the Center from ſuch diſtant parts of the <hi>Expanſum</hi> with ſo great a Celerity, they muſt needs have contracted an extraordinary heat much more than is requiſite for the ordinary Production of Plants; nay, as we may probably conjecture, a Heat nigh to an Inflammation. Which perhaps might have been the Cauſe, why the Waters were circumfuſed firſt round the Globe, when God might as eaſily have made them at firſt to ſettle into their Channels; but only to tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per the heat of the Agitated Particles. Now, Sir, if one was to meaſure the method of the Creation by the <hi>Vertuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo</hi>'s Rules, methinks we ſhould never have any recourſe to the Sun for the Production of Plants; for he produces them at a ſlow tedious rate, the Herbs once in a year, and the Trees in a much longer time. But here was to be a Plantation of the whole World in half a days time, and therefore there was need of a more ſpeedy Production. Now the new Earth, warm yet by its late agitation, and impregnated with the moiſture of the circumfuſed Waters,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:42179:79"/>
would make a kind of a warm Bed (to ſpeak in your way) for the haſty Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of Plants, and might raiſe up all the Herbage of the World as quick as <hi>Jonah</hi>'s Gourd, or a Chymical Sallad. So that I ſhould rather think, the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of your way, inſtead of finding fault with <hi>Moſes</hi> for a <hi>Plebeian</hi> Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, ſhould admire him for an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent <hi>Vertuoſo.</hi>

                  <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
                  <p>Now I have ſomething to ſay to the fourth days work, according to <hi>Moſes</hi> his Hypotheſis, the Deity muſt beſtir himſelf this day more than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary: For Sun, Moon, and Stars are a very conſiderable job of work for one day, eſpecially when the Furniture of our poor Earth took up ſo many. Indeed you have handſomely removed the difficulty of the fixed Stars, but then even each of thoſe ſix Planets which remain, would require as long a time for their Formation as this our Earth,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>O R.</hi> p. 72.</note> becauſe they are of the ſame form, and as we have reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve their Equipage is not very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like. Therefore I cannot be reconciled to your Prophet, for crowding the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of all theſe into one day. Beſides, I cannot ſee how the Relation of this
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:42179:79"/>
days work agrees, with the Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in your Scheme. For if the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets were formed, by the firſt ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of matter upon the firſt day, how can they be made the fourth? The <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panſum</hi> before this time ſeems to be drained of all matter but the Aether; and therefore I am at a loſs to find what the Sun could be made of. This does to me ſeem ſomething dark and myſterious, and requires a little of your Art, <hi>Credentius,</hi> to clear it up.</p>

                  <speaker>Cred.</speaker>
                  <p>This Objection, Sir, is a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle complicated, and therefore I ſhall anſwer to the parts of it diſtinctly.</p>
                  <p n="1">1.<note place="margin">How the Planets are ſaid to be made the fourth day.</note> Whereas you ſuppoſe that all the Planets were formed this fourth day, and had all thoſe Ornaments they are probably endowed, with then beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on them; this is more than can from Scripture be inferred. It is not improbable, that God Almighty wrought them all off one as ſoon as the other, and that they grew on to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection by the ſame degrees; ſo that the work of each of them was going forwards, from the firſt to the ſixth day. For all theſe Planets are ſo mutually linked to one another, and are ſo much of the ſame piece that one
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:42179:80"/>
cannot eaſily ſuppoſe the formation of either of them was diſtinct from that of another. Now though the bulk of theſe Planets were formed before this day, and in all probability ſome of their Ornamental Parts as perhaps their Seas and their Plants; yet they are ſaid to be <hi>made</hi> the fourth day, becauſe they are <hi>made</hi> the Moon and the Erratick <hi>Stars</hi> to us. They were before only Inviſible Globes, but by the Light of the Sun, which was this day Created, they became Conſpicuous and Reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the Earth a bright ſhining Light, which they borrowed from thence. Thence they are very proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaid to be made, becauſe though their ſubſtance was before, yet they were not a Moon, or Stars. For the <hi>formal reaſon</hi> which does conſtitute a Moon is its reflexion of light in ſuch conſtant viciſſitudes, its different Phaſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which is the notion the generality of Mankind frames of the Moon, now this it had not till the <hi>fourth</hi> day, and therefore is very properly ſaid to be <hi>made.</hi> For <hi>facere</hi> in the Latin Tongue has its derivation from <hi>novam faciem induere;</hi> ſo that a thing is then ſaid to be made when it has another appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:42179:80"/>
than it had before. Neither is the original word, <hi>gnaſah,</hi> which is uſed here much different. For that ſignifies not only any new formation, but any new uſe or outward appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of a thing. For ſometimes it ſignifies to ſacrifice, as the Latin Verb <hi>facere,</hi> ſo <hi>Exod</hi> 10.25. that we may <hi>make</hi> or <hi>ſacrifice unto the Lord our God.</hi> So Pſal. 66.15. <hi>I will make to thee an Ox with Goats.</hi> Which is a much bolder Metaphor, than that of <hi>Virgil, Cum faciam vitulâ pro frugibus.</hi> Now it is plain here, that the ſacrifice was made before, only the new offering it up, or dedicating it to a Religious uſe, is termed <hi>making.</hi> So Numbers the 9.10. it is termed <hi>making a Paſſover unto the Lord,</hi> where only the Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a time already made is termed <hi>making.</hi> So 1 King. 12.32. <hi>Jeroboam</hi> is ſaid to <hi>make the high places,</hi> and Chap. 25.32. Ahab <hi>made a Grove.</hi> Now God-Almighty had made thoſe Hills and Groves before, only thoſe wicked Princes dedicated them to thoſe Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous uſes. The Planets therefore, and eſpecially the Moon, are very properly ſaid to be made this fourth day; becauſe they made their firſt
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:42179:81"/>
                     <hi>appearance</hi> upon this day to the Earth, they had then their firſt <hi>uſe</hi> put upon them of being Luminaries to this World.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <note place="margin">Why <hi>Moſes</hi> relates the diſtinct formation of the Earth alone.</note>2. Although each of theſe Planets might take up as much time in its for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation as our Earth, yet <hi>Moſes</hi> is not to be blamed for not relating diſtinctly the formation of them. It is enough for his purpoſe to give an account ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly of the ſublunary Creation, and not to trouble the Peoples Heads with Aſtronomical niceties. His buſineſs was to give them an account of their Original from God, the better to keep them from Idolatry, and to relate to them the Creation of the World, ſo far as was agreeable to Truth and Conformable to their Capacities. To give them a falſe Syſtem of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſuch as ſimple people are apt to fanſie; is to make God a Lyar, nay, to confirm with his Authority the Idle Dreams of Men. And to give them a full account of the true Syſtem, was to confound their Thoughts, and it may be to deſtory their Faith; to make them disbelieve thoſe plain notions, they did under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, for the ſake of thoſe others, they
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:42179:81"/>
could have no apprehenſion of. To have given them a falſe Syſtem of the World to comply with their ſimple Capacities, would have been to have declared himſelf an Impoſtor, to all underſtanding men; and to have par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly unfolded all the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of the true one, would have been only to have appeared frantick, to ſuch an il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>literate Generation. For it was <hi>Moſes</hi> his buſineſs, to eſtabliſh a True Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion agreeable to the Divine Will, and to conduct the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> into the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> where they might have a free exerciſe of it; but it was the leaſt of his deſign, to perplex them with Phyſiological notions; ſo that for him to have talked of Planetary Vortices, of the Centrality of the Sun and a World in the Moon, would have made the poor Jews have ſuſpected, the Land of Promiſe was but ſome ſuch kind of Philoſophical Romance. God-Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty when he dictated this moſt admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Hiſtory to his Prophet <hi>Moſes,</hi> foreſaw that this was to be the Ground-work of his future Revelations, that upon the belief of this Creation by God, the fall by <hi>Adam,</hi> and the Reparation made by Jeſus Chriſt all Mankind was to be
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:42179:82"/>
ſaved; ſo that if he had deſcended to the particulars of Philoſophy, and ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with any diſtinct Sect of it, he would have laid a very great ſtumbling block in the way of Salvation; if he had explained the particulars of the Creation in the <hi>Ptolemaick</hi> way, all the refractary <hi>Copernicans</hi> and <hi>Tycho Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heans,</hi> muſt have been damned; or if he had took part with <hi>Copernicus,</hi> all the old faſhioned Gentlemen, that are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocates for the round-about Stars and the Solid Orbs, would be in as evil a Condition. <hi>Moſes</hi> therefore, by God's direction, took the middle and the wiſeſt Courſe, to ſpeak exact Truth, but ſeaſonably and cautiouſly; neither to confound the Minds of the ignorant Jews, nor to expoſe himſelf to Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phizing Chriſtians. I doubt not, but <hi>Moſes,</hi> being educated in all the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> was well verſed in the vulgar, or what is uſually call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Ptolemaick</hi> Hypotheſis; for that came into <hi>Greece</hi> from <hi>Aegypt;</hi> but that he ſhould not explain his Hiſtory of the Creation according to this Syſtem, and ſhew ſome particular marks of his notions lying this way, is a thing very unaccountable, and does ſeem to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:42179:82"/>
a particular providence of God, over-ruling this inſpired Perſon, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating matters almoſt contrary to his own ſentiments, for reaſons beſt known to the Divine Wiſdom.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But laſtly,<note place="margin">This rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion agrees with the foreſaid Hypotheſis.</note> to make this agree with the Scheme I ſhew'd you, I think no very great labour is requiſite: For I ſuppoſed in the firſt days work, that the <hi>Expanſum,</hi> or the ſpace of the <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus Orbis,</hi> was drained of all its Opake and Terreous matter; in the ſecond day it was fined again, by drawing off all its aqueous uninflammable matter; but beſides theſe, in all natural Bodies we find an unctuous inflammable ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, which did here remain ſtill diffuſed throughout the whole <hi>Expan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum;</hi> which upon the command of the Divine Word, ſubſided to the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tral point of the whole <hi>Magnus Orbis;</hi> all which vaſt quantity of unctuous Matter, being compacted together in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to one Globe, broke out that day into the <hi>Solar Flame.</hi> Vid. Fig. V.</p>
                  <p>And now the <hi>Expanſum</hi> was reduced to a pure liquid Aether, being utterly deveſted of all groſs and heterogeneous parts of Matter, and exquiſitely fitted for the Planets to ſwim about in; and
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:42179:83"/>
not only ſo, but was perfectly cleared of all clogging, irretiting Particles, ſo that it could communicate a <hi>tremor</hi> throughout its whole Diameter with the greateſt velocity. It is probable, that before this third refining of the <hi>Expanſum</hi> and the draining it of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuous Matter, which made the ſolar Globe, the Aether was in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure clogged with thoſe unctuous Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, ſo that it could not ſo eaſily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate a Light from a ſlender, or a remote Luminary, for want of a quick trepidation; which when they were removed to the Globe of the Sun, it could then do with very great readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. So that I very much queſtion, if upon the third day, an Eye had been placed in any part of the <hi>Expanſum,</hi> although it ſhould be out of the thick ſteams of the Planets, it could have ſeen the fixed Stars; becauſe the ſlender force of the Light of ſuch diſtant Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies could hardly have made force e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, to communicate a trepidation through ſo much ſpace, where the matter did not ſeem enough fined for it: For to produce the communication of Light, matter muſt be framed to a peculiar contexture and admirable fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:42179:83"/>
and ſet to a ſort of an <hi>equilibrium,</hi> ſo as to be moved by the leaſt touch; which it could not well be, before this third refining upon the fourth day. As ſoon as which was done, the light of the Stars appeared in all parts of the <hi>Expanſum,</hi> where-ever it was not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered by the vigorous Rays of the nigher Sun; ſo that hence-forward they conſtantly ſhone in their proper viciſſitudes, throughout all the Cones of the ſhadows of the ſeveral Planets. Therefore upon this account, in ſome ſenſe likewiſe, the fixed Stars might be ſaid to be made this day becauſe of their firſt appearance to the Earth, though they had their formation many Ages before. Although ſome perhaps will think the Metaphor is ſomething hard ſtrained this way, and therefore I apply it principally to the Moon, who received her firſt Phaſis from the Sun this day which may be very properly termed her formation, becauſe they are thoſe Phaſes which do denominate her a Moon in reſpect of us. It was this day that the Moon began her Nocturnal Regency, it was now that by her borrowed light from the Sun by reaſon of her vicinity to the Earth,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:42179:84"/>
ſhe out-ſhone to us all thoſe fixed Stars at a diſtance, which ſhine with ſuch prodigious Globes of their own Light.</p>

                  <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
                  <p>I do aſſure you, <hi>Credentius,</hi> I can receive either of your Explications, concerning the formation of the Stars, as well as what I find in your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentators upon the points; for there is ſome degree of probability in either. But I had rather take any thing for grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, than own the fixed Stars to come in for one job of Work, in this puny Creation. As for the fifth days Work I ſhall paſs over that, for I do not find any great abſurdity therein; but there are ſeveral things in the ſixth day which will never go down with me: For <hi>Moſes</hi> then ſeems to make the whole World to be ſtocked with one pair of Animals of each ſort, or to be ſure he makes but one Man and one Woman to People all the Earth, which is mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrouſly abſurd: For any common Obſerver of Nature may take notice, how careful ſhe is for the propagation of Kinds; that ſhe is rather guilty of a ſuperfoetation, than a Parſimony this way. How many millions of Acorns doth one ſingle Oak produce, during the time of its ſtanding, any one of
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:42179:84"/>
which is capable of renewing its Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies? Not to mention the <hi>Polypodium,</hi> and ſuch other ſuper-abundantly fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Plants, there is not an Apple, or a Pear-Tree, but what produces ten thouſand times more Kernels, than what is abſolutely neceſſary. And if the Hypotheſis of Mr. <hi>Lewenhoeck</hi> be true, as I never ſaw any good reaſon to the contrary, that the <hi>Foetus</hi> is produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced from an Animalcule in the ſperm of the Male, what myriads of theſe are produced every concoction? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whereas Nature is ſo over and above careful in the propagation of kinds, when ſhe is in a manner profuſe in the production of Seeds, that ſhe may be ſure to obviate all manner of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingencies and Lets which could poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly happen; how can we ſuppoſe, that ſhe acted by ſuch contrary Methods, in the firſt formation of things? If there were but two of a ſort created, upon what miſerable uncertainties did the perfection of the Univerſe depend? If any one Male or Female had died before it had produced its kind, there had been a ſpecies loſt for ever. Nay a Lion, a Bear, or a Wolf, might have eaten up half a ſcore of ſome Species,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:42179:85"/>
for a Breakfaſt. If <hi>Adam</hi> had been as much a Villain as his Son <hi>Cain,</hi> he might have ſerved his Wife as <hi>Cain</hi> did his Brother.

Now if any of theſe things had happened, the Deity had been put to the trouble of a new Creation.

                  <p>I confeſs, <hi>Philologus,</hi> there is in this Argument a Philoſophical prettineſs, and that is all, ſuch as will take with ſome of the <hi>Vertuoſo</hi> part of the World, who prefer an Experiment to a Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, but it does not ſo with me; for I have learned to make my Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy ſtrike ſail to my Faith, and to think that Omnipotency can do that, which ordinary nature is at a loſs for. But, as I have obſerved before, you Philoſophical Gentlemen do not argue juſtly, when you argue from the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary and <hi>Conſervative,</hi>

                     <pb n="136" facs="tcp:42179:86"/>
then God acted abſolutely by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controulable <hi>Power,</hi> but now he has in ſome meaſure given the reins out of his own Hand, he has in many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees made over his Original Power to his Creatures, and left it to the Determination of Free-Will, and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to the lets and impediments of what we call Caſual Events. So that it was very wiſely contrived of the Deity, after the Alienation of this Original Power, to be more abundantly cautious in the Production of Species, when the Power of Production was delivered up to other hands. Whilſt God-Almighty made all things by his Abſolute Creative Power, his Almighty <hi>Fiat</hi> could not but produce a <hi>neceſſary</hi> Effect; but when he delivered this over to ſecond Cauſes which acted but weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and ſometimes corruptly, there was then need that he ſhould make more ample proviſion for the propagation of Species, and for the prevention of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages in their Production, when the immediate cauſes were not Omnipotent.

their numbers, they were able to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter with extraordinary contingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.

For I look upon Navigation to be an Art rather revived than improved in theſe two laſt Centuries. It was the Roman Conqueſt throughout the World, that put a ſtop to this noble Art; for the <hi>Phoeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi> and <hi>Carthaginians</hi> were more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert in this, than ever the <hi>Romans</hi> could pretend to. Nor did they ever indeed in good earneſt bend their minds to this Art; for their chiefeſt aim was to advance their Empire in the Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, and the Fleets they fitted out were chiefly Tranſports for their Forces, except once or twice, when they were forced to Naval fights by
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:42179:88"/>
ſome potent Enemies at Sea; but they rarely, or never employ'd Ships for foreign Negotiations, and Diſcoveries. So that it is no wonder, we ſhould have been deprived of all Intercourſe with <hi>America,</hi> during the Power of that Empire, and thoſe Ages of Barbarity which enſued it. But long before <hi>Caeſar</hi> the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> made Voyages for Tin and Lead into <hi>Britain,</hi> which is ſo vaſt a Diſtance from your Country, whence the Britiſh Iſles got the name of <hi>Caſſiterides.</hi> The Navigations and the <hi>Periplus</hi> of <hi>Hanno</hi> the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> are ſufficiently famous, who coaſted round <hi>Africk</hi> by the Order of the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginian</hi> Senate; and he lived conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly before the time of <hi>Darius Nothus,</hi> as <hi>Iſaac Voſſius</hi> has made appear. It is plain, that the Ancients Sailed up the <hi>African</hi> Sea, as far as <hi>Madagaſcar,</hi> call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Menuthias,</hi> or the Greater <hi>Cerne,</hi> as ſome will have it; but I believe as far as <hi>Ceylon</hi> or <hi>Summatra;</hi> for 'tis moſt probable, that <hi>Pliny</hi> means one of thoſe Iſlands, and not <hi>Madagaſcar,</hi> by the name of <hi>Cerne.</hi> For he deſcribes <hi>Cerne an Iſland over againſt the Bay of</hi> Perſia, <hi>off from</hi> Aethiopia, <hi>whoſe Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and diſtance is not manifeſt from the

For we do little more, in one of our longeſt <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Voyages. Upon the whole therefore it is no Argument, that <hi>America</hi> was not peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled from the other parts of the World, becauſe the latter Ages wanted skill to ſail thither, or becauſe Hiſtory ſays nothing of it. For all our Hiſtory comes from the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> and they were too ignorant in Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, to mention or to credit ſuch a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, though they might have it from other Nations.<note place="margin">Diod.

For if theſe three parts of the World could be ſtocked ſo full, with the progeny of but two perſons, in leſs than four thouſand years, the other fourth part might be peopled from as ſmall a ſtock, in a ſhorter time. Beſides, it ſeems to me a plain Argument that the <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans</hi> are but a later Drain from the Inhabitants of the other parts of the World, becauſe <hi>America</hi> is thinner peopled than the reſt; to mention nothing of the Tradition they have in common with other Nations of a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge which is a very clear proof of their Deſcent from <hi>Noah.</hi>

The Poſterity of a White Woman, in <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiopia,</hi> will in a generation or two be all Negro; and the great Grand-Children of a Black Man and a White Woman with us, will hardly be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed from other <hi>Europeans.</hi> So that from hence it does appear, that Blacks may Beget Whites, and Whites Blacks: but then this, you will ſay, ſuppoſes a commixture of both ſorts, but how could it come to paſs that, when all the World was Whites, any ſuch thing as a Black could come into the World? why, If I my Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phize
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:42179:90"/>
in this matter, and call in ſecond Cauſes, I think there is ſome reaſon for it. You know, <hi>Philologus,</hi> the complexion of Mankind does ſtrangely diverſify according to the nature of the <hi>Climate;</hi> the Hair and Skin of the Inhabitants of the diverſe parts of the World alter, as they are farther or nearer from the Sun; the <hi>Danes</hi> and <hi>Swedes, Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Scotch,</hi> being much Nothern, have generally a Brown, White, or Yellowiſh Hair, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what Lank; the <hi>Spaniards, Italians, Greeks, Arabians,</hi> &amp;c. have black hair ſomewhat curled, and ſo proportionably all other more Southern Nations; the <hi>Europeans</hi> generally have a clear White Skin, the <hi>Aſiaticks</hi> a more Tawny one, as being much nigher the Sun.<note place="margin">This black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs cauſed by the heat of the Sun,</note> But the <hi>Aethiopians</hi> living in a Country where the Sun is more ſcorching than in any place of the World, it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, they ſhould be more black than any Nation. For they live not only directly under the line, but in the middeſt of a mighty Continent, where they are refreſhed by no cool breezes from the Sea, where the Air is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually heated by ſweeping along over fiery Sands, were the Sun receives a
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:42179:91"/>
double force by being reflected from ſuch prodigious Mountains; now if the warmth of <hi>Aſia</hi> is of efficacy e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to make the skin of its Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants tawny, and to curl their Hair; we may eaſily ſuppoſe, the intenſe heat of <hi>Aethiopia</hi> is ſufficient to make its Inhabitants much blacker in their complexion; and to criſp their hair in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a ſort of frizze. Therefore we may very well conclude, that the firſt Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, which ſetled in a Country of that extraordinary heat, received a very great change in their skins proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably to the Heat of their Country and became mighty Tawny, much beyond the <hi>Arabians,</hi> and inclinable to Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as the Sun is more intenſe upon them. Hence, in a Generation or two, that high degree of Tawnineſs became the nature, and from thence the Pride of the Inhabitants; the Men began to value themſelves chiefly upon this complexion, and the Women to affect them the better for it; from thence by the love to the Male ſo complexioned, the daily converſation with him and the affectation of his hew, there was cauſed a conſiderable Influence upon the <hi>Foetus</hi>'s which the Females were
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:42179:91"/>
pregnant with; ſo that, upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, the Children in <hi>Aethiopia</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came more and more black, according to the fancy of the Mother. Thus we find <hi>Jacob</hi> multiplyed the ſpotted kind in <hi>Laban</hi>'s herd, and thus <hi>Heliodorus</hi> in his <hi>Aethiopicks,</hi> makes his fair <hi>Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clea</hi> to be born of Blackamore Parents, only by her Mother's contemplating the Picture of <hi>Andromede,</hi> in her Bed-Chamber. The Children thus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced muſt be ſuppoſed to come nigher and nigher to an abſolute black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; but when the tender bodies of ſuch Children were expoſed to the ſcorching heat of the <hi>African</hi> Sun, and naked too as is the cuſtom of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, their thin skins muſt needs be more than ordinary burnt by ſo great a heat, and be made more black than their Parents. And ſo by theſe degrees they might very well come to be ſuch perfect Negroes as we find them. Thus far we may Philoſophize upon the point, by pure Natural Reaſon. But the Holy Scripture gives us a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther light into this matter.<note place="margin">By the Curſe of <hi>Cham.</hi>

the <hi>Europeans</hi> and <hi>Aſiaticks</hi> are pretty conformable, the modern Northern Languages are very nigh the ſame, and ſo are the <hi>Spaniſh, Italian,</hi> and <hi>French;</hi> and as for the ancient Eaſtern Tongues, they ſeem to be but different Dialects (as the Learned that way ſay) of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> or <hi>Chaldee.</hi> But, as for the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mericans,</hi> they do <hi>toto coelo diſtare,</hi> in all their Cuſtoms from us; and if you do look upon an <hi>American</hi> Vocabulary, as you may ſee ſeveral of them in <hi>De Laet</hi>'s Hiſtory of <hi>America,</hi> you can hardly pick out one word that ſounds any thing like thoſe, in any other Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage ancient or modern. <hi>Grotius,</hi> with all his Wit, was not able to pick out above three or four, neither of which will hold water,<note place="margin">De Laet de Orig. Amer.</note> which <hi>De Laet</hi> taking advantage of, has horribly expoſed that Learned Man for. So that, if the <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans</hi> had deſcended from any of theſe parts of the World, they would moſt undoubtedly have retained ſome of their Cuſtoms and Words, and not have ſtood at ſo vaſt a diſtance from us, in every thing, as we find they do.</p>

                  <p>It is no Argument that the <hi>Americans</hi> were not derived from the <hi>Europeans,</hi> or other Inhabitants of the
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:42179:94"/>
World, becauſe their Language does not ſo well agree with ours. For Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages alter mightily in time, even where they maintain a correſpondence with thoſe people of the firſt Original Tongue; but muſt needs vary vaſtly more in the <hi>Americans,</hi> who were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly cut off from all ſuch converſation. And beſides, it is not true that all Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, beſides the <hi>American</hi> ones, ſeem to be derived from ſome other, and have a nigh reſemblance to one another; for as far as ever I was able to remark, <hi>Iriſh</hi> and <hi>Welſh,</hi> and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of the Languages of the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> are as different from the learned, or the other <hi>European</hi> Languages, as the <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican</hi> Tongues are. So that, by this Argument, the <hi>Britains</hi> and <hi>Iriſh,</hi> and moſt of the Eaſtern Nations muſt be <hi>Aborigines</hi> too, as well as the <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And as for the Cuſtoms of the <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans,</hi> they are not ſo very different as you would pretend; nay they retain in many things ſuch an uniformity of practice with us, as affords an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dubitable proof, that they are of the ſame Original. I will not inſtance in ſuch actions, which are natural and
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:42179:94"/>
common to all men, ſuch as are the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult of humane paſſions, or are ſo eaſy of invention, as they can hardly be avoided, as Singing, Dancing, Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Leaping, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but in ſuch actions as are owing to ſome one lucky Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or tranſcribed from others by imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; which they cannot all be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to have lighted upon themſelves, but muſt have them communicated to them by others. It would be no Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to prove this Original, becauſe I did ſee an <hi>American</hi> capering an odd kind of Jigg; but if I ſhould ſee two <hi>Americans</hi> playing a Game at Tennis, or Baggamon, or writing an <hi>Italian</hi> hand, I ſhould be confident, they learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this from ſome <hi>European.</hi> And many Cuſtoms of this ſort we find among them, learned from other parts of the World, which are an unanſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Argument for their Deſcent from them.</p>
                  <p>To begin firſt with ſome of their <hi>Religious Rites,</hi> and particularly <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</hi> Though it ſhould be granted, that natural Religion was common to all men, yet what reaſon can be aſſigned, that the <hi>Americans</hi> who are by you ſuppoſed to have no communication
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:42179:95"/>
with the reſt of the World, ſhould worſhip God with juſt ſuch poſitive Rites, as the far greateſt part of the World did? There are ſeveral ways of worſhipping God, which they might have took, and a thouſand Religious Rites they might have made uſe of; but why they ſhould juſt jump upon <hi>ſacrifice</hi> with the reſt of the World, is unaccountable. But granting ſacrifice as an eaſy deduction from natural reaſon, as it is not, and that all men muſt think it rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, that their ſins muſt be expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the blood of Beaſts, which was a ſort of vicarious life taken away, in lieu of their own which was forfeited. How came they to be acquainted with this <hi>Adamical</hi> puniſhment, and to know that the Wages of Sin was Death? This muſt be all grounded upon Scripture or ancient Tradition, which the Heathens all over the World ſtuck faſt to, though they could give no reaſon for it; and which the <hi>Americans</hi> could never have come to the knowledge of, unleſs they had been derived from other Nations, and had had the ſame univerſal Original. But though this vicarious puniſhment of
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:42179:95"/>
Beaſts ſhould be allowed to be natural, how ſhould they come to perform it juſt the ſame way, as the other parts of the World did, which they had no converſe with. One would have thought, that in this caſe ſtrangling, or jugulation ſhould be the moſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and proper way of diſpatching the vicarious Victim, and appeaſing the Deity, and the ſacrifice ſhould terminate here; but what reaſon can be given, why they with the reſt of the World ſhould burn the Fleſh of the Victim, and that they ſhould think, that God was to be reconciled by the ſmell of broiled Meat? There is no manner of rational account to be given for this, and they might as well have raiſed a ſmoak to the Deity by wet Straw, or Water and Lime, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way, had they been left free to their own Invention. 'Tis plain there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that they received this manner of Sacrificing from the other parts of the World, who had it by Tradition delivered down to them from the firſt Parents.</p>
                  <p>Beſides this there are ſeveral other Rites and Arbitrary ways of Worſhip, which they muſt be ſuppoſed to have
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:42179:96"/>
received from the <hi>Europeans</hi> or <hi>Aſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks.</hi> The Children of <hi>Mexico,</hi> and <hi>Jucatan,</hi> are circumciſed. And the <hi>Mexican</hi> Prieſts, like the Veſtals, keep a conſtant and unextinguiſhed F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>e. They celebrate a Jubilee every fiftieth year like the Jews, and as ſome write a Sabbath every ſeventh day. They launce their Bodies and let out their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> like the Prieſts of <hi>Baal,</hi> to ſhew the earneſtneſs of their Devotion. The <hi>Caribbeans</hi> obſerve the New-Moons, as the Jews did, with the ſound of Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets and great Shouts. The <hi>Peruvians</hi> obſerve a kind of a Mock-Paſſover, by colouring the Threſhold of their Houſes with a kind of Pulſe mixed with Blood. I omit the Relations which ſome <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Authors have made concerning the uſe of Baptiſm amongſt ſome of them, and ſignations with the Croſs, becauſe ſome have queſtioned theſe Authorities; but theſe other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations are indubitable and agreed to by all, as may be ſeen in the Hiſtories of <hi>Joſephus, Acoſta, Herrera, Garcilaſſus de Vega, Johannes de Laet</hi> and <hi>Purchas.</hi> Now it cannot be ſuppoſed, that theſe <hi>Americans</hi> ſhould hold ſuch a wonde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous uniformity with other Nations,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:42179:96"/>
with whom they never had any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, but had a perfect different Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal.</p>
                  <p>And ſo again, at the time of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> diſcovery of theſe People, they found them exerciſing an abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Arts and Inventions, which ow'd their Original to the <hi>Europeans</hi> or <hi>Aſiaticks,</hi> which they could never have come to the knowledge of, unleſs by a commerce with them, or a deſcent from them. And if we were to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in no other, the Art of Number<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo exactly conformable to ours, were a ſufficient Argument of their Deſcent from us. Now why ſhould the <hi>Americans,</hi> if they had not learned numbring from us, reckon by <hi>Tens?</hi> why ſhould <hi>Ten</hi> ſtill be their Climacte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical, or Gradual Number, and why ſhould they make their aſcent by <hi>Tens</hi> to the higheſt Number, as by ſo many Steps? Why might they not as well have made either 8, or 9, or 15, the terminative number, and given names to the doubling, or trebling of theſe, inſtead of Thirty, Forty, <hi>&amp;c?</hi> Why might they not have taken up with the <hi>Gothick</hi> way of reckoning by Dozens, or a thouſand other ways, they might
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:42179:97"/>
have made uſe of, beſides Decimals? Now becauſe we find the <hi>Americans</hi> rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon juſt our way, have invented names only for the decimal Numbers, <hi>viz.</hi> 10, 20, 100, 1000. (with the nine ſmall Numbers or Units) and whereas there were many other ways of reckoning beſides, ſome of which would be more convenient as being more capable of Diviſion, <hi>viz.</hi> 8, 12, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that they have made uſe only of our way by Decimals; it can never be ſuppoſed but they muſt have learned their Art of Numbring from us. And ſo likewiſe their Fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Bows and Arrows, their Arts of Spinning, Weaving, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> do moſt ſtrongly confirm their Origin from our Parts. The Invention of Bows and Arrows ſeem altogether as Fortuitous and as Odd, as that of Guns; and a Man that was ignorant of both the Arts would take a Bullet to be a better offenſive Weapon than an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. How ſhould they come to fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and barb their Arrows, and wear their Quivers upon their Shoulders, juſt like the ancient <hi>Europeans,</hi> had they not learned it from them? So that I conclude, the <hi>Americans</hi> could no more have had the Art of Archery; unleſs
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:42179:97"/>
from this part of the World, than they could have that of Gunnery. The like may be ſaid of Spinning and Weaving, which are wonderful Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which Mankind might have been without for many thouſands of years, unleſs they had been beholding to ſome lucky hit for the Invention of them. Now we cannot ſuppoſe, that the ſame lucky hits ſhould happen, in ſo different parts of the World, that had no communication with each other, and that they ſhould improve theſe hints, by the very ſame Artificial Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods; and therefore we muſt conclude that thoſe firſt Colonies, which plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>America,</hi> learned thoſe Arts among us here.</p>
                  <p>And now laſtly, <hi>Philologus,</hi> by this obſervation we may learn, how very anciently <hi>America</hi> was Peopled, it may be a very ſhort time after the Flood. For the <hi>Americans</hi> have only, among them, thoſe Arts, which were of the earlieſt Invention, as thoſe which we have before mentioned; but as for <hi>Writing,</hi> which was later, they are perfectly ignorant of. So that, in all probability, <hi>America</hi> was Peopled, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Invention of Writing; for
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:42179:98"/>
they cannot be ſuppoſed to have loſt ſo uſeful an Art, or that all, who came thither, were perfect ſtrangers to it. Writing I ſuppoſe was invented about <hi>Abraham</hi>'s time, ſo that the firſt Colonies into <hi>America</hi> muſt precede that; which was in ſo very early an Age of the World, that a ſmall number of Perſons would be ſtock ſufficient for it.</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
                  <p>Some things in this Argument indeed look pretty probable, but there are two things in your ſuppoſition, which I cannot digeſt; for you ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that theſe firſt Colonies came over thither by chance in Boats, which is the moſt common opinion, and which I find you are moſt inclined to; but then ſay I in the firſt place, how got the Women over? I can well enough fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy a Boats Crew of Tarpawlins blown over thither, but that would be <hi>Florus</hi>'s <hi>Res unius aetatis, Populus Virorum,</hi> they would have dropped off by degrees and left no breed behind them. So that you muſt have recourſe to ſome Female Navigators to make good your Opinion, which, being a thing ſo very unuſual, makes it altogether Incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible. And then again in the ſecond
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:42179:98"/>
place, I cannot imagine How <hi>America</hi> ſhould be ſtocked with Beaſts and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Animals, having no Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation with the Reſt of the World. I ſuppoſe, you will not make Foxes, and Lyons, and Dogs, and Hares, and the reſt of the Quadrupeds turn Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gators too, and ſend out their Colonies from theſe parts of the World. Or if you ſay the firſt Planters of <hi>America</hi> brought them over with them, this might paſs well enough with us, as to the uſeful Animals and thoſe proper for food; but Lyons and Bears, methinks, ſhould be the laſt thing Men ſhould carry on Shipboard with them; for truly they do not ſeem to be ſuch good natured Creatures, that men ſhould be ſo in love with them, as to endeavour to increaſe their Breed. How ſhould men ever come to carry over ſuch Noxious Creatures, as Lyons and Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gres, and yet omit ſuch uſeful ones as Horſes and Sheep? Nay how ſhould ſeveral whole Species of Animals, all run into <hi>America;</hi> for there are ſeveral ſorts of Creatures there, which are to be found in no part of the World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides. Pray get over this, <hi>Credentius,</hi> and then we may poſſibly allow <hi>America</hi>
                     <pb n="162" facs="tcp:42179:99"/>
to be peopled from this part of the World.</p>

                  <p>When there are demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Arguments for any thing, it is not every difficulty, ſhould make us disbelieve it; for we ſee every day things come to paſs, which we cannot aſſign a reaſon for. Though we ſhould not be able to give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, how Women and Quadrupeds were tranſplanted there, yet the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty we have of their Deſcent from theſe parts of the World, by the Arts and Cuſtoms they enjoy in common with us, are ſufficient motives to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline us to believe, that its firſt Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants came from theſe parts. But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever theſe difficulties, which you have ſtarted, are not ſo unanſwerable as you would pretend. For as for the ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of carrying Women on Shipboard, I think that may be eaſily accounted for, if we allow that the Ancients made any Voyages to <hi>America,</hi> as ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend; for then the <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, might carry over Women thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as well as we do now adays to our Plantations there. Or if we aſſert that chance brought the firſt Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants thither, as it did to <hi>Alphonſo
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:42179:99"/>
Sanctio,</hi> who firſt informed <hi>Columbus</hi> of <hi>America;</hi> there might be probably Women on board ſuch a Veſſel, for in thoſe early Ages of the World, the Women were more Maſculine and Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſt, and leſs bred up to delicateneſs; they frequently attended their Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands in Warlike Expeditions, and in other actions of Difficulty and Danger.<note place="margin">Ant. Kni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet. Relat.</note> Nay 'tis uſual ſtill among the <hi>Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans</hi> to have their Wives follow them into the Camp, and to carry their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions for them. So that it is nothing improbable, to think that the firſt Veſſel which came to <hi>America,</hi> had in it Perſons of both Sexes. But the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt difficulty is about the tranſportation of the Animals; eſpecially thoſe of the wild Kind, and ſuch as are not to be found in theſe parts. As for Lyons and Bears, I do not think, they were brought over in Ships, they probably got thither by the way of <hi>Greenland,</hi> where the paſſage is but narrow; and 'tis incredible to think, how far ſuch Creatures will ſwim; for Travellers tell us, they have ſeen Bears, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſwim nine or ten Leagues together. As for the Fowls, obſervations of Navigators tell, what vaſt Tracts of Sea they can
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:42179:100"/>
fly over, by their diſcovering them over their Heads, in the midſt of the Ocean; which is done without any difficulty and with prodigious ſwift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs by thoſe Birds, that fly ſo high, as to get out of the vehement attraction of the Earth, and can puſh on without the renitency of the groſſer Atmoſphere. Others of their Animals are amphibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, ſuch as the <hi>Morſh,</hi> a great ſort of deformed Sea-Calf, and the <hi>Tatu,</hi> or <hi>Armadillo,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Vid. Laet. Hiſt. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. Lib. <hi>15.</hi> Cap. <hi>6.</hi>
                     </note> a Scaly Animal about the bigneſs of a Pigg; as alſo many others of the Serpentine kind the <hi>Boytiopua, Giboya, Ibiboboca,</hi> &amp;c. And theſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt, might eaſy enough have been preſerved in the Waters of the Flood. The greateſt difficulty is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ſuch terreſtrial Animals, as are to be found in no other part of the World beſides; how they ſhould eſcape being deſtroy'd in the Deluge, or if they were deſtroy'd, how the Breed came to be reſtored, when this part of the World had no Animals like them. To obviate this objection, ſome have aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted <hi>Noah</hi>'s Deluge to be only To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pical, and as far as the World was In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited; but thoſe Beds of Shells, Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefied Bones of Fiſh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> found in
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:42179:100"/>
                     <hi>America,</hi> are undeniable Arguments, of the univerſality of it. Therefore, one of theſe two things muſt be aſſerted, either that God-Almighty, after the <hi>Noaical</hi> Deluge, created anew the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in <hi>America;</hi> or elſe that he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved them in an extraordinary man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as he did thoſe in this part of the World in <hi>Noah</hi>'s Ark. And if I were left to my ſelf, I ſhould think this latter was the way which God took; and this fairly anſwers all the difficulties which ariſe upon any other ſuppoſition, and ſeems agreeable to the Divine practice in other matters.</p>
                  <p>But however if we cannot be ſo fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful as to believe this, yet it is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible to think how variouſly Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures may be altered by being tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted to different Climates, and by commixtures of the ſame, or analogous Species. Of which the innumerous kinds of Dogs are a remarkable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. And how great a difference the alteration of the Climate will create may be judged, from the Opinion of thoſe who aſſert, that the ſame <hi>Croco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dile</hi> of <hi>Aegypt</hi> is the <hi>Lizzard</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> and the <hi>Eff</hi> in our Country.</p>

                  <p>There is I confeſs, <hi>Credentius,</hi>
                     <pb n="166" facs="tcp:42179:101"/>
ſomething of probability in this; but can you ſay as much for the Formation of <hi>Eve</hi> out of her Husband's Side. I have nothing to ſay to the Creation of Animals, for I do not obſerve any ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity in <hi>Moſes</hi>'s account of them. But methinks, this making of Woman-kind out of a Rib, out-does by many degrees the Poetical Fables of <hi>Pyrrha,</hi> and <hi>Cadmus.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>O.R.</hi> p. 32.</note> I proteſt this is the oddeſt piece of Matter to make a Woman of, which could be thought of. But to let this paſs. Had <hi>Adam</hi> more Ribs than other People or no? If you ſay no, then to be ſure he wanted a Rib of one ſide or other; then we had had a maimed Progenitor, a very ſad ſample for the Archetypal Man. If you ſay, he had a Rib to ſpare, this would have made a Monſter of the Glorious <hi>Adam;</hi> for it would have been as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious, as three Hands, or four Eyes. But though I could ſwallow all this, yet I can never beat it into my Head, how a Womans Body could be made of a little Rib, which does not equal the hundredth, or perhaps the thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſandth part of it. To ſay that bulk was ſupplied by borrowed matter, will not much avail; for then <hi>Eve</hi> had
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:42179:101"/>
more truly been ſaid to have been made out of that larger portion of borrowed matter, whatever it was, than out of the Rib. Come, <hi>Credentius,</hi> ſet your ſhoulders to this difficulty.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Cred.</speaker>
                  <p>Indeed, Sir,<note place="margin">No abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity that <hi>Eve</hi> ſhould be made of a Rib.</note> I think I need hardly ſet my finger to it. For we need not ſo much as grant you, that the Original word, which we tranſlate <hi>Rib,</hi> does ſignify ſo there; for it gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſignifies a <hi>Side,</hi> and the Septuagint tranſlate it in this place by the Greek word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which ſignifies ſo, and ſo in moſt other places; but never ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it by any word which denotes a Rib. So that, if this oddneſs of the Rib ſticks ſo much with you, you may ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it <hi>Side,</hi> ſo that God formed the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man out of one of the Sides of <hi>Adam,</hi> or of both the Sides, which the Original may imply. That is, God took ſome part of the Subſtance of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Body about his Side, he cloſed up the Orifice again, and out of this Subſtance he form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Eve.</hi> Or if the meaning be, that he took the Rib with the Fleſh, I do not ſee how that marrs the matter: For if it was the will of God, to form the Woman out of Man, for my part I do not ſee how in all the whole Body he
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:42179:102"/>
could take it from a more proper place. If God deſigned any myſtical meaning by it, it is the propereſt, to have form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her, like <hi>Minerva</hi> of the Poets, out of the Head, would have entitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led her to a Superiority, which God did not intend; to have made her from any inferiour, or more diſhonour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able part, would not have agreed with their Equality and Partnerſhip which ſhe was allotted for. I doubt not but if Mankind ſhould propagate, as the <hi>Religio Medici</hi> would have them, like Trees, and if <hi>Moſes</hi> had related the Production of the firſt Woman in the ordinary way of generation now; you Theiſtical Wits would have expoſed it, as being altogether as ridiculous as the Rib: For that oddneſs, which you laugh at, is only the unuſualneſs of it, which if it were more common, would look natural enough. So again, for my part, I do not ſee, how that if <hi>Adam</hi> had wanted a Rib after this for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, he would have been ſuch a maimed Creature as you would make him, for why might not God have ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied him with another, having taken this from him? Neither can I appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend him to have been ſuch a three-handed

Monſter, altho' he ſhould have had this Rib ſuperfluous in him. For, to uſe <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> his compariſon, this Rib was like the ſeed of Animals and Vegetables, ſuperfluous for the Perfection of the <hi>Individuum,</hi> but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the Generation of the Off-ſpring. The Rib, was ſuperfluous to <hi>Adam,</hi> as a private perſon, but neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, as the Origin from which the Woman, and all Mankind, was to be produced. As for the Abſurdity you would infer, from the ſmallneſs of the quantity of matter in a Rib, to make a Woman of; if you will be pleaſed to think but of an Acorn, or a Muſtard-ſeed, you will never uſe that Argument more.</p>

For he perfectly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates two Creations of Mankind, one of the common Race of men within the ſix days, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.27. and another of the ſacred Race of the Jews, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.9. Before God created <hi>Eve,</hi> he ſaid there was not a <hi>Meet help for him,</hi> that is none of the wicked Ante-Adamical race were fit Wives for that Holy Man. When <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid <hi>Cain</hi> was a Tiller of the Ground, he muſt needs ſuppoſe, there were at that time all the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers which have relation to Tillage, not only Smiths, and Carpenters, but Millers, and Bakers. So when <hi>Cain</hi> murthers his Brother <hi>Abel,</hi> he entices him
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:42179:103"/>
into the <hi>field</hi> for fear any body ſhould ſee him; which ſuppoſes that they dwelt in ſome Town where there were too many Eyes to watch him, where note the word <hi>field</hi> does plainly anſwer to <hi>Town</hi> or City. When <hi>Cain</hi> ſays <hi>every one that findeth me ſhall ſlay me,</hi> he ſuppoſes a great number of men in the World. And when God ſet a mark upon this Parricide for fear any one ſhould ſlay him, it ſuppoſes there were many men in the World which might accidentally do it. Beſides, <hi>Moſes</hi> ſays <hi>Cain</hi> went into the Land of <hi>Nod,</hi> and married a Wife, and builded a City, where it muſt be thought, there were Women for him to marry, and Men to inhabit his City. But <hi>Joſephus</hi> is more plain, for he ſays he ſtruck in with a pack of raſcally Robbers and became their Head. Now it is plain from all this, that <hi>Moſes</hi> would not have it preſumed, that he wrote here of the primitive Parents of all the World; ſeeing that within a few lines he lets fall ſo many Expreſſions which denote the contrary. He deſigned on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to give an account of the Origin of the Jews, as other Legiſlators have given out of other Countries; but the
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:42179:104"/>

But however to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr a remarkable paſſage in Hiſtory, and to reaſſume it to ſpeak more largely of it in another place, is a thing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all Hiſtorians. But they that ground a new Creation upon that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſumption or Repetition, may as well make as many Creations as they find the old one mentioned in the Pſalms, or Prophets, or New Teſtament. As for the next Argument of <hi>Adam</hi>'s not finding a help meet for him, that does not in the leaſt imply that there were a number of other Men and Women in the World; but it only denotes, that there was as yet no Woman in the World. Which is an expreſſion not unlike that of <hi>Ovid.</hi>

                  <p>Now one might with as good a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour pretend, that the Poet allow'd with the Author of the <hi>Praeadamites,</hi> there was a wicked Generation of Men before, and his Deſcription is the Creation of the <hi>Holy</hi> one. But to be ſhort, methinks this expreſſion, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the circumſtances, is very ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite in the ordinary ſenſe. <hi>Adam</hi> had juſt before all the Animals, Male and Female, brought before him, to name them; now he might very well think it ſtrange, that he of all the Creation ſhould be the ſingle ſpecies, and ſo might the Reader of this Relation, as well as he; and therefore <hi>Moſes</hi> ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joins, <hi>but for</hi> Adam <hi>there was not found an help meet for him,</hi> for God had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd the Creation of the Woman, till ſome time afterwards. And I don't ſee, how any other tolerable ſenſe can be put upon the words. As for your next Objection of <hi>Cain</hi>'s being a Tiller of the Ground, which requires the Aſſiſtance of many other precedent Arts; this is eaſily to be anſwered by ſaying, that
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:42179:106"/>
this Art of Tillage was not in its full perfection in <hi>Cain</hi>'s time, that he might be a Tiller of the Ground without all thoſe Inſtruments we uſe for our Convenience now; he might make uſe of wooden Ploughs or Spades; and form his Tools with ſharp flints or ſhells inſtead of Knives and Hatchets, which were the firſt Inſtruments of cutting,<note place="margin">Devolvit ipſe acuto ſibi ponde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra ſilice. <hi>Catul. de At.</hi>

And again, as for <hi>Cain</hi>'s ſaying, <hi>every one that findeth me ſhall ſlay me,</hi> God's ſetting a mark upon him, his marrying a Wife and building a City in the land of <hi>Nod,</hi> it does by no means ſuppoſe a former Generation of <hi>Praeadamites.</hi> For the word <hi>Nod</hi> does not neceſſarily ſignify a Country, but it may ſignify a <hi>fugitive;</hi> ſo that the ſenſe may be, <hi>he lived a Fugitive, or Vagabond in the Land.</hi> Neither, if we ſhould grant, there were a conſiderable
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:42179:106"/>
number of Men in the World at that time, would it make for this <hi>Praeada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitical</hi> Hypotheſis; for they might all be deſcended from <hi>Adam.</hi> For this Murder of <hi>Abel</hi> happened, in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability, in the 129 year of <hi>Adam.</hi> For the Scripture ſays expreſly that <hi>Seth</hi> was born in the 130th year, <hi>Gen.</hi> 5.3. and <hi>Seth</hi> was given in the lieu of <hi>Abel.</hi> For <hi>Eve</hi> ſays Gen. 4.25. <hi>God has appointed me another ſeed inſtead of</hi> Abel <hi>whom</hi> Cain <hi>ſlew.</hi> Therefore it is moſt probable, that he was born the year after the murder, to be a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to the firſt Parents after ſo ſad an affliction, having never ſeen the death of any of their Off-ſpring before. So that then <hi>Cain</hi> muſt be 129 years old, when he took his flight, at leaſt. Now 'tis no wonder that then there ſhould be a conſiderable number of Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants in the World; for it is not likely that <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> had no Children all that time; it is probable they had a great many, and that there was a competent ſtock of Mankind by this time, to the number it may be of an hundred thouſand, conſidering the primitive fecundity. For if the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Iſrael</hi> from 70 Souls in the
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:42179:107"/>
ſpace of 210 years became 600,000 fighting men, whereas a great number of them died during the Increaſe, we may well enough ſuppoſe that the Children of <hi>Adam</hi> might amount to 100,000 in 130 years,<note place="margin">

Deity beſtir himſelf to ſome purpoſe, as if he began to grow weary of his Creating, and was reſolved to have his work over by the Week's end. For, to ſet aſide this naming of the Animals, which, to conſider the nature of each and to adapt them a name to it, would require no ſmall time; let us ſee what a hurry there muſt be, for the tranſaction of other matters. In the firſt place, there were ſo many thouſand of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals created, then there was a counſel called for the Creation of Man, who had at firſt a Body formed out of Clay, and a Soul Breathed into it by God; then <hi>Adam</hi> falls a ſleep, and had a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs formed out of one of his Ribs; when he wakes, he performs (as muſt be ſuppoſed) ſome Ceremonies of Courtſhip to the new-found Lady, gains her Affections, and celebrates an Extemporary Marriage; the Woman leaves her new Husband and falls a parlying with an ugly Serpent, or the Devil, about an Apple; after a deal of arguing <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con,</hi> the Woman yields to the Beaſt, eats the Apple, tempts her Husband, makes his mouth water, and he eats too; then their nature is altered, they loſe their Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:42179:108"/>
and their ſenſe, find out one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers blind ſide, are aſhamed of their nakedneſs, commence Tailors <hi>extem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore,</hi> ſew Fig-leaves together and make themſelves fine green Aprons. Then God in the Evening comes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Garden, the Guilty Criminals hide themſelves in the Thickets, God ſummons them, they appear, there is a fair hearing of the Cauſe, they make their excuſes, and after a full Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation God decrees to the Man, Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and Serpent the Puniſhments they had merited. Then they are drove out of Paradiſe, two Angels with bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſht Swords are ſet Centinels at the Garden door, and poor <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> are forced into the Woods, to take up their Lodging among the Beaſts.

                     <note place="margin">No confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed huddle in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the ſixth day's work,</note> we ſhould deny all this which you take for granted, that the matter of all this Relation was tranſacted in one day, and that the Animals took ſo long a journey to wait on <hi>Adam;</hi> then all this fine Harangue falls to nothing. And indeed I do not ſee any thing in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to countenance it, it is only the general Opinion of the Schools, who ſuppoſe the Fall of Man to have happened the firſt day of his Creation; and this is grounded upon an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which I ſee nothing in; which is, becauſe otherwiſe <hi>Adam</hi> might have begotten a Child in his Innocency, and then would not have traduced his Guilt to his Poſterity. I ſhall not trouble my ſelf to confute this Argument, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is only a wild ſuppoſition, and which may be anſwered by twenty
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:42179:109"/>
ſuppoſitions as probable on the other ſide. My buſineſs I undertook with you is to vindicate the Authority of the Scripture, and not the Schoolmens Hypotheſes; and I do not here find any abſurdity in that, whatever your ſuppoſition may bring along with it. For</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <note place="margin">The lapſe of Man, not the firſt day of his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note>1ſt, Here is not a word in Scripture of the Lapſe happening the ſixth day of the Worlds Creation, or the firſt of Mans, and therefore you ought not to impute any abſurdities to the <hi>Moſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> account, which may follow from that Opinion. Indeed thoſe Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which you have urged out of Mr. <hi>Gataker,</hi> ſhew, that all theſe things could not be tranſacted in one day; but if they were done in many the Authority of the Scripture remains en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire; and truly the Arguments of that Learned Man (which he has brought to confute the Opinion of the Schools, and you have borrowed to expoſe the <hi>Moſaical</hi> account) to me ſeem very concluſive. But beſides, I have other reaſons to think that the Lapſe of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind did not happen the firſt day; but that there did a conſiderable time inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vene before this unhappy miſcarriage.
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:42179:109"/>
I doubt not but that <hi>Adam</hi> before the fall was endowed with an extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry degree of Knowledge, for I can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver agree with the <hi>Socinians,</hi> that he was ſuch a poor ignorant Idiot as they would make of him. But then I am apt to believe, that this Knowledge inclined more to the Angelical and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuitive, than to the Experimental and Diſcurſive one. For it proceeded on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the extraordinary Influence of the divine grace, and not from his own deductions, experiments and diſcourſe. So that though <hi>Adam</hi> were never ſo wiſe a Creature I much queſtion whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he had the inſpired power of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as the Apoſtles had. For words are pure placitory things, and depend upon the mutual Agreement of the Speaker, and the Hearer; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 'tis moſt reaſonable to think that <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> coined their own words themſelves. The difference between the Apoſtles and them, was very wide; becauſe the Apoſtles ſpoke to men who underſtood thoſe Languages; but if <hi>Adam</hi> had ſpoke to <hi>Eve</hi> Hebrew, or Greek, ſhe could have no more under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood him, than if he had held his Tongue. They, that maintain this
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:42179:110"/>
Opinion muſt have recourſe to Inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon Inſpiration, and Miracle upon Miracle; there muſt be one In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration for <hi>Adam</hi> to ſpeak, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for <hi>Eve</hi> to underſtand; there muſt be the immediate Aſſiſtance of the Holy Ghoſt for every word and ſylla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and that too with a double efficacy, not only for the Information of the Hearer, but to make the Speaker un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand his own words. It remains therefore, that the firſt Parents framed a language for themſelves, which muſt be a conſiderable time a compoſing; ſo that whereas we find them readily diſcourſing at the time of the Lapſe both with God, the Serpent, and themſelves, it muſt follow that not only the fall, but the naming of the Animals muſt be at ſuch a convenient diſtance of time from the Creation, as might give them leiſure to frame the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage. Which time cannot be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be over-long becauſe their extraordinary Intellectual Capacity, they were then endowed with, would mightily facilitate their Invention of words, and proper adapting them to things. And 2ly, We may draw ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Reaſon, that the Lapſe did not
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:42179:110"/>
happen upon the firſt day from <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 8. from their being acquainted with <hi>the voice of God walking in the garden in the cool of the Day,</hi> which implies they were uſed and much accuſtomed to the divine preſence, or <hi>Shechinah,</hi> that they were able to know it ſo readily, which they could not be ſuppoſed to do in one day. And laſtly, the ſame Verſe informs us, that they <hi>hid them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves among the Trees of the Garden,</hi> which ſhews they were better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with it, than they could be in an hour or two, ſo as to find out the darkeſt thickets and umbrages of it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There is another thing which you take for granted in this ſuppoſition, that is not ſo very certain; and that is, That in the ſixth day's Creation there were Animals created all over the World, and placed in thoſe diverſe parts of it, we find them in now. The World might be very well ſtocked by a pair or two of each kind created a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Eden,</hi> and their breed might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe as Mankind multiplied. And if ſo (as the Scripture ſays nothing for it, or againſt it) <hi>Adam</hi> might name all thoſe Animals with eaſe enough, and
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:42179:111"/>
not trouble them to take ſuch long Journeys as you ſuppoſe.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If we ſhould grant that the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals were ſcattered at firſt all over the Earth, ſome peculiar to one Country, and ſome to another; yet it does not follow from the words of <hi>Moſes,</hi> that <hi>Adam</hi> muſt give names to all theſe. It is ſufficient, that he named thoſe An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, that were ſeated in that part of the World where <hi>Eden</hi> ſtood. For it was to all intents and purpoſes ſufficient for him to know, what to call thoſe Creatures, which he was to be conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant with, and was to make uſe of; but it would ſignify very little, for him to make a Vocabulary of a number of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, that were to reſide ſo many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand miles from him, and which he was never like to ſee again, after his Nomination. So that truly, <hi>Philologus,</hi> I do not ſee any of theſe formidable dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties you imagine in this Objection; unleſs we allow all thoſe ſuppoſitions you have a mind to pin upon the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, without any warrant from it. And now let us ſee, if you have any more to ſay againſt the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

And that is, that of all the accounts which in all Nations have been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be given of the Origin of the World, this is the wiſeſt and moſt Philoſophical. Which to me is a conſiderable proof of its divine Revelation; eſpecially conſidering at what a low ebb Letters and Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy ran in the Jewiſh Nation: So that I am apt to believe the Jews were no more able to invent ſuch a wiſe and intelligible Syſtem of the World, than they were able to make the World it ſelf. And this we may be the better convinced of, if we reflect a little upon accounts which other Nations give of it. What a wretched account was that of the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi>

That God made at firſt the Throne of God, <hi>Adam,</hi> Paradiſe, and a great Pen, with which he wrote his Decrees. That this Throne was carried about upon Angels necks, whoſe Heads were ſo big, that Birds could not fly in a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years from one Ear to the other. That this great Pen is a Journey of five hundred years long, and one of eighty years broad. That the Stars are fire-brands, thrown againſt the Devils, that would invade Heaven. That the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is propped up by the Mountain <hi>Kaff,</hi> which is made all of Emerald.
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:42179:112"/>
That the Moon is as big as the Sun, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> laps his Wing over a part of it. That the Earth ſtands upon the tip of a great Cows-Horn, that this Cow ſtands upon a white Stone, and that Stone upon a Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and that Mountain upon God knows what. That it is a Journey of a thouſand years from one Horn of this Cow to the other: with a deal more of this ſtuff. Now if you could find ſuch Farce as this is in the <hi>Moſaical</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, you might very well expoſe it; but I am ſure you have little reaſon to do it, when the whole tenour of it is ſo reaſonable and judicious.</p>
                  <p>I ſhould ſeem too long, and it may be too ludicrous, if I ſhould pick out all the ſimple Tales, from the Books of Travels into ſeveral parts of the World; of the firſt Origin of things. It ſhall content me only to inſtance in two great and different parts of it, and that is in the <hi>Americans,</hi> and the <hi>Chineſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Americans</hi> (eſpecially the <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons</hi>) make all things proceed from a Spirit called <hi>Cudovangi,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican.</note> who ſhot ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Arrows into the ground, which grew to be Men; that this God begot a very good Son, but had a very wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

And as for the <hi>Chineſe,</hi> that knowing Nation, which you Theiſts are wont to cry up for the ſtandard of Primitive Learning, and Genuine Antiquity, let us ſee how they mend the matter in their account. And they tell us that one <hi>Tayn</hi> who lived in Heaven, famous for his Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, diſpoſed the parts of the World into the order we find them. That he created out of nothing the firſt Man <hi>Panſon,</hi> and his Wife <hi>Panſone.</hi> That <hi>Panſon</hi> by a deligated Power from <hi>Tayn,</hi> created another Man called <hi>Tanhom,</hi> who was a great Naturaliſt and Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician, and underſtanding the nature of things gave names to them; and this <hi>Tanhom</hi> had 13 Brethren ſo created, and ſo the World was Peopled at firſt: Then after a while the Sky fell down upon the Earth, and deſtroyed them; and then the wiſe <hi>Tayn</hi> created another Man called <hi>Lotzizam</hi> who had two Horns, and a Body of an odoriferous ſmell; from him proceeded many Men and Women who ſtocked the World with its preſent Inhabitants; who when he had left Breed enough diſappeared

and went I know not where.

diſingenuity of the Gentlemen of your way, they firſt dreſs up the Scripture in a Monſtrous ſhape, and then bait it when you have done.

nothing but Boldneſs, and make them admire that for a fine ſaying which is only an unuſual one; for men, that talk after this manner, do not ſpeak what other men cannot ſay, but what they dare not. Now wiſe men pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently diſcern this falſe light and the little Arts which are uſed in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of it, and conſequently do not ſuffer themſelves to be deceived by it; they conſider theſe holy things as they are, and not as they are wantonly repreſented: all the miſchief that this Diſcourſe is like to do, is among your little unthinking Things, that ſet up for <hi>Wit</hi> without common <hi>Senſe,</hi> and cry up every thing for extraordinary reaſon, which, has nothing in it but Clinch and Jingle.

                  <p>I perceive, dear <hi>Credentius,</hi> that this is touching you in a tender place, and therefore I ſhall forbear all reflections, which are not neceſſary to my Argument. But I muſt needs tell you that there are a great many things in this relation of the <hi>Fall</hi> which you call <hi>difficult</hi> and we call <hi>ridiculous;</hi> but let them be what they will, they are ſuch, that will keep a thinking Man from heartily believing your Religion, till he ſees them handſomly cleared up. And the firſt of theſe is the Temptation
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:42179:115"/>
of <hi>Eve</hi> by the Serpent. Now is it not a little odd, <hi>Credentius,</hi> that ſuch an ugly Beaſt as a Serpent, ſhould ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to accoſt ſuch a fine Lady, in all her Supralapſarian Beauty?<note place="margin">
                        <hi>O. R.</hi> p. 39, 40, &amp;c.</note> I pray what kind of Language did Serpents then ſpeak, for we find they have no other than that of hiſſing now? Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks <hi>Eve</hi> ſhould have run away from ſuch a ſpeaking Beaſt, faſter than from an Apparition, and never have enter'd into a Conference with it. Why ſhould a Serpent, I pray, of all the Beaſts of the field, have all this Reaſon and Elocution beſtow'd upon it? Methinks a Lyon, or a Bull would have made a good full-mouthed Orator; but for a pitiful Snake to have ſuch mighty Talents of Rhetorick and Perſwaſion, is really very ſurprizing. But ſuppoſing you ſay, that the Devil poſſeſſing the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans of this Serpent tempted the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. I anſwer, I think he made as ſilly a choice of a Body as ever Devil did, to perform this Temptation in. To have ſeen ſuch an odd kind of ſtupid Beaſt of a ſudden turned rational, to hear that ſpeak which was dumb be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, would probably have ſcared the poor Woman out of her Wits: ſhe would

quickly, I ſuppoſe, have left the Devil and the Apple together, and have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took her ſelf to her Heels and her Husband to ſecure her. Beſides, here is not a word of the Devil's poſſeſſing the Body of the Serpent in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of <hi>Moſes;</hi> for he imputes the Woman's being circumvented wholly to the Subtilty of the Serpent; this is only a ſhift of your Divines to bring in the Devil, as the Poets uſed to do the Gods, to help them out at a dead lift.

                  <p n="1">1. Therefore I aſſert, that the Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which deceived our firſt Parents, was the Devil, ſome wicked malicious Spirit that envied the good of Mankind, and thoſe extraordinary favours, which God has ſo plentifully beſtowed on our firſt Parents; which enclined him to tempt them to diſobedience, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to bring them into the ſame forlorn condition with himſelf, and the other
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:42179:116"/>
fallen Angels. That the Serpent is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mentioned, whoſe Body the Devil made uſe of, is owing to a Metonymy common in the Hebrew Tongue, which uſes the Inſtrumental for the Efficient Cauſe, and the Efficient for the Inſtrumental; of which multitude of Inſtances may be given, out of the Scripture. Thus the Angels, which God employ'd about the deſtruction of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrha,</hi> are called by the name of the Lord. <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. and what they ſay and do, is ſaid to be done by the Lord. So on the other ſide the Divine Predictions of God-Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty are ſaid to be the words of the Prophets, which he employ'd as In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments to ſpeak them. Thus, <hi>Amos</hi> 1. 1. <hi>The Words of</hi> Amos, <hi>who was among the Herdſmen of</hi> Tekoa, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So <hi>Jer.</hi> 1. what is called, <hi>v.</hi> 2. <hi>The Word of the Lord,</hi> is called, <hi>v.</hi> 1. <hi>The Words of</hi> Jeremiah <hi>the Son of</hi> Hilkiah. So by the Word, by Faith, and by the Sacraments, we are ſaid to be ſaved; whereas theſe are only the Inſtruments God makes uſe of in our Salvation. So the Miniſters of the Goſpel are ſaid to bind and to looſe; whereas 'tis God only which does it by their Miniſtry. Therefore
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:42179:117"/>
it is no wonder, if by the ſame Meto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nymy, what is ſpoken or done by the Devil is ſaid to be ſpoken or done by the Serpent, whoſe Organs he uſurped. But further it is plain, that it was the Devil which managed this Deceit, not only from the Incongruouſneſs of a Brute Beaſt's over-reaching Mankind in his higheſt pitch of Reaſon, but from the Atteſtation of the Holy Scripture it ſelf. The Author of the Book of Wiſdom, who well underſtood the Doctrines and Traditions of the Jewiſh Church, and the ſenſe of the holy Scripture, tells us expreſly that <hi>by the Envy of the Devil Death came into the World,</hi> Wiſd. 2.24. And our bleſſed Saviour who was a better Explainer of the Scriptures, tells us, the <hi>Devil was a Murderer from the beginning,</hi> or the firſt Creation, alluding to his miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous deſtruction of Mankind; that he is a <hi>Lyar and the Father of Lyes,</hi> both in the firſt and all the following Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation of Mankind. Nay, farther than this, the Devil is expreſly in Scripture called the Serpent, <hi>and the Dragon was caſt out, that old Serpent called the Devil and Satan,</hi> Rev. 12.9. <hi>and he laid hold on the Dragon that old Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,

and charms in verſe, the Serpent lifts up himſelf and opens his Mouth, and thruſts out the head of a beautiful Virgin; the Devil thereby glorying, in this miſcarriage among thoſe poor Idolaters. And ſome Books of Travels into the <hi>Weſt-Indies</hi> give the like account there. Now ſince the Devil has made uſe of theſe viperous Animals in his ſervice in ſo many parts of the World; why ſhould men find fault with <hi>Moſes</hi> his Hiſtory, for aſſerting a thing, ſo agreeable to the experience of all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind?</p>

<pb n="205" facs="tcp:42179:120"/>
rather than own a God who would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit any thing to croſs their humour. Now you make uſe of the Inverſe of that Argument, and would prove that becauſe there is a good God, therefore he would never ſuffer ſuch a wicked action of the Devil. But, that which is the ground of both theſe Arguments, is an unreaſonable miſtake, <hi>viz.</hi> the opinion that a <hi>Juſt and Wiſe God cannot permit Evil.</hi> Now it is true, that there are ſome part of <hi>natural Evils</hi> which God could not permit, ſuch as might happen to the inanimate parts of the Creation, as any blundered irregular formation of their parts, any defect in their nature or conſtitution. For all ſuch <hi>Evil</hi> as this muſt then needs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from God, who gave them this irregular nature, in which they could have no hand themſelves. Therefore we freely own, that God cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit <hi>Evil</hi> of this kind; becauſe ſuch permiſſion were tantamount to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it.

But you'll ſay it is not the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty how to reconcile God's Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with the permiſſion of Evil; but how to think he ſhould permit an Evil of ſo vaſt a conſequence.

For God to have given them ſuch powerful Influxes of his Spirit, as to have made it impoſſible for them to Sin, would have been in effect to have altered

their natures, and to have changed them from <hi>free</hi> to <hi>neceſſary</hi> Agents. For that would have been to have over-ruled them by as abſolute an Impulſe, as he does Stones and Trees.

                  <p>It is true,<note place="margin">The Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the two Trees not ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous.</note> things look very ſtrange and odd that are unuſual; which makes us we can hardly forbear laughing at an old Faſhion, after ſome time of diſuſe; though we liked it well enough, when it was common. Now the State of Innocence and the lapſed State of Mankind, being ſo very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, we muſt ſuppoſe, that there were ſome things conſonant to the firſt State very diſagreeable to our preſent one; and this is but reaſonable to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine. Now of a great number of theſe <hi>Moſes</hi> has reckoned but a few, amongſt which are theſe Trees. As for the
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:42179:124"/>
                     <hi>Tree of Life,</hi> I cannot imagine any thing more agreeable to ſuch a State of Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence. Now a State of Innocence ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes Immortality, for Death came by Sin; and ſomething was requiſite to make men Immortal, when their Bodies naturally were not ſo. Indeed God might have done this, by his immediate Almighty Power; but he generally cooperates with ſecond cauſes. Now what fitter means can we ſuppoſe, for the continual renovation of Mens Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, without any manner of decay, than the fruit of ſuch a Tree? If ſome Food of an extraordinary quality be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite, why not the Fruit of a Tree, as well as the Fleſh of an Animal; as well as an Herb, a Root, or any thing elſe? When God had deſigned, that Mens Bodies ſhould never yield to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay, or Death, methinks it was very reaſonable, for him to direct them to the eating a certain fruit of a Tree, whoſe juice was of that ſpirituous na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as to impregnate their blood with an indefectible vigour, and to keep them in a conſtant Youth, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out pain, or diſeaſe, or imbecillity, 'till ſuch time as he ſhould tranſlate them to a better World. And this I
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:42179:124"/>
take to be the uſe of the Tree of Life. It is uncertain whether or no this Tree was but one ſingle one, and always to be continued in <hi>Eden,</hi> if there had been no lapſe; it is moſt probable ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them would have been tranſplan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to other parts of the World, as the innocent Off-ſpring had increaſed: but when Mankind had ſinned, it is proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that God deſtroyed this ſpecies out of the World as being now grown uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, and inconſiſtent with the Curſe and Puniſhment of Man. And this the Heathens ſeem to have ſome tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional notion of, when they ſpeak of the <hi>Nectar</hi> and <hi>Ambroſia,</hi> which main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the Immortality of their Gods, and <hi>Moly</hi> which was the great <hi>Panacea,</hi> celebrated by the Heathen Poets. As for the <hi>Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil,</hi> it was I ſuppoſe called ſo, not becauſe it had a vertue to confer any ſuch knowledge; but becauſe the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil pretended in his Temptation of the Woman it had, it receiving its name from that unfortunate Deception. And tho' God calls it the <hi>Tree of the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Good and Evil,</hi> before the Fall, yet that is related by <hi>Moſes</hi> by way of Anticipation; as if I ſhould ſay the

It might be, for ought we know, a very conſiderable part of the habitable Earth; which the the <hi>Ante-diluvians</hi> were kept out of, or at leaſt were ſo for a conſiderable time. Now, if <hi>Eden</hi> was of ſo large a circumference, it might afford an ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to ſeveral very diſtant Rivers. So that <hi>Adam</hi> might only cultivate that part of it, which he was firſt placed in. 2ly, It is likewiſe very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain, what Rivers are meant by theſe Hebrew names. As for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters, they are ſo various in their Conjectures, that it would be tedious to recount them. It ſeems moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable to me, that theſe Rivers are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſome branches of the River <hi>Euphra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi>
                     <pb n="216" facs="tcp:42179:126"/>
if ſo be the Channel of the River had a being before the Flood. 3ly, It can never be exactly known where theſe Rivers were, becauſe of the great alteration made in the World by the Deluge, which has mightily altered, or it may be obliterated their Courſe. For I believe, that at the Flood, the mighty confluence of Waters over the Face of the Earth, and the breaking open the Deep or Subterraneous Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, turned the Earth into ſomething like its Chaotick <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, or that Mud it was at the firſt Creation; ſo that the Courſe of Rivers muſt be altered, by the waſhing away their Banks and the choaking up their Channels. And therefore it is in vain, to ſeek for theſe <hi>Ante-diluvian</hi> Rivers, in thoſe Courſes of Waters, that trickle over the Earth now. And therefore you do very ill, to cenſure the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Writings, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you cannot find thoſe Rivers now a days, which he ſpeaks of before the Flood.</p>

                  <p>But by the way, Sir, if <hi>Moſes</hi> deſcribes theſe Rivers as they were before the Flood, which you ſuppoſe to be different from what they are now; this will render it a very idle

                     <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lologus,</hi> to think, that the aim of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> in this deſcription of the Rivers, was for men to find out Paradiſe by; for the Holy Scripture does not uſe to condeſcend, to ſatisfy Mens Inquiſitive Curioſities. It was the deſign of the Holy Ghoſt, in this relation, to aquaint Poſterity with the Beauty of that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py place, which our firſt Parents un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunately forfeited; but, I dare ſay, it was not the leaſt of his Intention, to leave minutes for Witty Men to write Books, and draw Maps by. But, I pray, was there never a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription made of any thing, but only to teach men how to find it by? Some things are deſcribed, that are paſt and gone, as the relation of the actions of Men, Sieges, Battles, Tumults, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſo are impoſſible to be found; other things are related in a ſhorter manner,

when they need not be found, as <hi>Paul</hi> was buried at <hi>Rome, Pompey</hi> was conquered at <hi>Philippi,</hi> now it would be non-ſenſe in the Hiſtorians to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe exactly the Vault or ſpot of Ground where the Apoſtles Body was laid; or to ſhew the particular ground which was covered by each Army; So that the Reader, if he pleaſed might go directly to them.

                  <p>The next thing, <hi>Credentius,</hi> I have to accoſt you with, is, The Great Law which <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> were to be tried by, and all Mankind ſtand or fall, by the keeping, or the breaking of it. Now one would think, that a Law, upon which effects of ſo vaſt a conſequence did depend, muſt be ſome mighty wiſe precept in it ſelf,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:42179:127"/>
moſt admirably conducing to the good of Mankind and the honour and Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the Legiſlator, but inſtead of this, we find only a poor little trivial thing commanded, only forſooth the not eating of an Apple. A reaſonable man would ſuppoſe, that theſe wiſe couple with the Supralapſarian Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, ſhould have had a Law given them for their Trial ſuitable to their great Capacities, ſome ſupereminent rules of moral Vertue, ſuch as Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers talk of and leave for others to practiſe; ſome noble part of your Chriſtian Charity, or ſeraphick Love, which ſome of your melting Divines make ſuch fine ſpeeches upon; theſe would have been precepts agreeable to that wiſe and glorious State, but ſuch a ludicrous Law as this does not only ſeem to be an undervaluing to the Wiſdom of the Deity, but even to Man himſelf, to be dealt with ſo like a Child, as this comes to.</p>

                  <p>I perceive this is an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,<note place="margin">The reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs of the Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept.</note> which Infidels have made uſe of in all Ages, down from <hi>Julian</hi> and <hi>Celſus,</hi> to the little Coffee-Houſe and Tavern Wits in our Time. But for my part, I could never ſee any ſtrength
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:42179:128"/>
in this Argument, nor any ridiculouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in this Law, nor any thing fit to be laughed at, but only their fooliſh management of it. As for your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions againſt this Law, that it was the prohibition of ſuch a ſmall indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Thing, and not ſome great Rule of Morality, will you be pleaſed to take this anſwer, which I am perſuad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed will ſatisfy you, or will at leaſt ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence you, from making ſport with this paſſage of Scripture any more.</p>
                  <p>It is acknowledged by all, that the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Tables are a good ſhort Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtem of Morality and take in all the general heads of moral Vertues, and therefore we will run through theſe, and ſee if any precept here was ſo fit to be given <hi>Adam</hi> for a Trial, as that which <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid he had.<note place="margin">The Prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of an Apple more proper than any thing elſe.</note> To begin with the firſt Table which relates to the Divine Worſhip and Reverence. Suppoſe the <hi>Worſhip of falſe Gods</hi> or Image-Worſhip, had been forbidden him. Had not that been ten times more ridiculous than the Apple? For the Worſhip of falſe Gods was a thing, which came into the World ſeveral hundred of years afterwards, when men grew ſo ſtupid as to take the Sun
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:42179:128"/>
and Moon for Gods and began to flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their Princes into divine honours. Neither would the Prohibition of <hi>Image-Worſhip</hi> have been any Trial; for we can never ſuppoſe <hi>Adam,</hi> to have been ſuch a Sot, as to have made an Image and to have fell down before it himſelf. Beſides, Images were long after brought into Worſhip, either to flatter living Princes, or elſe to ſupply the place of dead ones, whom the ſilly People fanſied were become Gods. Neither would the prohibition of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury or vain Swearing, have been a better way of Probation. Perjury was a thing not to be heard of, till the World was better Peopled, when Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce and Trade came into uſe, when Courts of Judicature were ſetled, when Men began to cheat one another, and then to deny it and forſwear it. And vain Oaths could never have a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a ſtate of Innocence, for they muſt have their Origin in a corrupt Lying ſtate of the World, when Men began to uſe them to aſcertain others they were ſincere in this matter, though they might be falſe in other matters; till afterwards, by frequent uſe, they grew habitual and cuſtomary words.
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:42179:129"/>
Neither were any Particularities in the <hi>Divine-Worſhip</hi> proper to be command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them; for Temples, and Prieſt, and Garments, and weekly and Anniverſary Holidays, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were things perfectly inconſiſtent with that Infant ſtate of the World. The like may be ſaid of other duties commanded in the ſecond Table. How could <hi>Adam</hi> have ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured his Father and Mother, when he never had any? What temptation could he poſſibly have, to be guilty of Murder, when there was no Man or Woman in the World, but his own Wife; whom if he ſhould deſtroy, he would not only be excluded from Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage again, but muſt needs ſpend his whole Life after in a miſerable ſolitude? How could he commit Adultery, when <hi>Eve</hi> was the only Woman upon Earth? How could he be guilty of Theft, when he was the ſole Lord of all the Creation? How could he bear falſe Witneſs againſt his Neighbour, or Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet his Goods, when there was no Neigbour in the World for him to be thus unjuſt to. And ſo if you go on to the Chriſtian Precepts. What part of Charity was he in a capacity of exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing? How could he forgive Injuries
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:42179:129"/>
and love Enemies, who had no one to offend againſt him? What charitable wiſhes and thoughts could he have of his Neighbour, when as yet there was neither Neighbour nor Sin in the World? How was it poſſible for him, to exerciſe the Duties of Mortification, Self-Denyal and taking up the Croſs, who had no Luſt to conquer, no Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to overcome, who lived in ſuch a delicious place as he could experience no want or diſquiet. As for the Love of God, that was as natural to the Soul before the Fall, as it is for the Body to eat and drink; ſo that to have made that his Tryal, would have been as abſurd, as to have bid him to be ſure to walk upon the ground and breath in the Air, which he could not but do. It remains therefore, that his Probation was moſt properly to be performed, by a Command of doing or forbearing ſome <hi>Indifferent</hi> Action, which was neither Good nor Evil, but only as it was commanded or forbidden. Now if it be requiſite or fitting, that his Obedience ſhould be tried in doing or forbearing ſuch an indifferent thing why was not this firſt Law for forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Fruit of a certain Tree in the
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:42179:130"/>
Garden, as proper as a Law prohibiting any indifferent thing elſe? Nay there is more reaſon for this prohibition, than that of other things, becauſe that which was prohibited was natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and appoſite, not ſtrange and far fetched. The firſt Parents being to live in a Garden, what more natural to be forbidden them, than the eating ſuch a ſort of Fruit? If ſome odd ſtrange thing had been commanded them, which had no manner of relation to their way of living, we might have had ſomething to ſay againſt it. If they had been commanded not to ſtudy Mathematicks, or Magick, to make long Pilgrimages to <hi>Mecca</hi> or <hi>Loretto,</hi> to climb once or twice a year up to the Top of Mount <hi>Caucaſus;</hi> or a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand more of theſe indifferent things, only to try their Obedience, there would be none of them half ſo proper as this, which God made choice of; nay, I defy the Wit of Mankind to find out an indifferent thing to be prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, which was ſo natural and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the State of Mankind then, as this was. So that this Law is ſo far from being Ridiculous and Ludicrous, that it muſt ſeem very wiſe and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:42179:130"/>
and grounded upon a very judicious Choice to all conſidering Men.</p>

                     <hi>Philologus,</hi> to imagine, that this Sin of our firſt Parents, was ſuch a little ſlip, as you would pretend. It was the greateſt Sin which ever was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, unleſs it be the Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt: For, if we conſider the nature of the Crime, the mighty com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of offences in it, and the great advantages they had to avoid it; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can appear more heinous: For
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:42179:131"/>
this Sin was, not only a bare Diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of God's Command, but a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect <hi>Infidelity</hi> to God's promiſes and threats; it was a ſort of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> in believing the Devil, and putting a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Truſt in him than God; it was a horrible <hi>Pride</hi> in them to deſire to be <hi>like God,</hi> ſuch a Diabolical <hi>Pride,</hi> as made the Evil Angels fall from their firſt Eſtate; it was a very great <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs</hi> and <hi>Theft,</hi> to deſire and to purloin that, which was none of their own; it was a ſort of the moſt cruel and unparallell'd <hi>Murder,</hi> to kill and deſtroy the poor Souls of ſo many Thouſand of their Off-ſpring. Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der again, that this was a Diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence againſt God, an Infinite Being and of Infinite Dignity, a God that had given them a Being, and that ſo very lately too, the impreſſes of which could not be worn out of their Memory, that had beſtow'd ſo much happineſs upon them, more than on all the Creation beſides; that had made them Lords o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it all, and reſtrain'd nothing from them, but only the Fruit of this one Tree. Conſider further, that they committed this Sin againſt the cleareſt Conviction of Conſcience, when they
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:42179:131"/>
had minds fully Illuminated with the Divine Spirit, and had all poſſible aſſiſtances of Grace to keep them from Sin, and had no untoward bent of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and unruly paſſions to provoke them to it. Now to take all this to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, it was a mighty aggravation of their Sin, and ſets it at ſo high a rate, that it is hardly poſſible, for a Man, now adays, to commit a Crime of ſo great an Enormity. So that, <hi>Philologus,</hi> this was ſo far from being one of your Peccadillo's, that it aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted Heaven with the higheſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation.</p>

                  <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
                  <p>But I know not how to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile with the Juſtice of God this Curſe of his; to puniſh all <hi>Adam</hi>'s Poſterity, for his and his Wife's Sin. Why ſhould ſo many poor Innocent wretches, that are born from their Loins, ſuffer for the Sins of their Great-Great-Grand-Father? We ſhould think it very hard, for the King to hang up a number of his Subjects, only becauſe their Predeceſſours were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in the Barons Wars. And can we think that God-Almighty will be ſo unmerciful, as to call us to an account for the Crime of an old Forefather,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:42179:132"/>
committed above five thouſand years ago? Your Divines may ſay what they pleaſe of Original Sin; but I can no more be perſwaded, that Sin can go in a Blood, than that a Man's Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Learning can: For I believe a Man may be born a Philoſopher, or a Divine as well as he can be born a Sinner. But ſuppoſe there was ſuch a Traductive Guilt, a Man would no more deſerve Puniſhment for it, than he would do for inheriting his Fathers Diſtempers; which methinks does de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve pity and not puniſhment. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed you would fain ſalve all this hardſhip, by the Benefits of your Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Baptiſm; but then you leave all the poor Children which die unbapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed to make Faggots for the Devil. This ſevere Curſe, eſpecially as your Chriſtian Theologers explain it, does by no means agree with the Divine Juſtice and Clemency; nay, it ſeems inconſiſtent with his holineſs too, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this Guilt muſt be infuſed into the Soul by God when he makes it; which does argue a double pravity in the Deity, firſt to implant Sin in Man, and then to puniſh him for it.</p>

                     <hi>This Original Sin is not any viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Habit infuſed into our Souls by God,</hi> for that was to make God the Author of it. It is only an Obliquity of our nature and a tendency to Evil, as being deſcended from a corrupt ſtock, which cannot produce a pure Off-ſpring; ſo that God is not to be blamed any more, for ſuffering ſuch an impure Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geny to be born from our firſt Parents, than he is for letting ſour Fruit ariſe from a Tree degenerated by our ill Husbandry, or diſeaſed Children from vitious Parents. Indeed in all Ages, Divines have troubled themſelves, to explain how this obliquity ſhould be conveyed to all Mankind, and the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of them agree that it comes from the defect of <hi>Original Righteouſneſs,</hi> or the withdrawing of that ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Grace which was ſo plentifully beſtowed upon the Primaeval Parents, and they have forfeited for us; ſo that that Bar, which was to hinder us from Sin is now taken away, and ſo we ruſh with precipitancy upon it; that

                     <hi>Fraenum</hi> which they call it, that Bridle, which was to reſtrain our Animal Faculties is loſt by their Sin, and ſo now, like an unruly Horſe, they over-power and run away with our Reaſon.

Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of which Explications are incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the Divine Juſtice; for God was neither obliged to continue this ſupernatural Grace to all <hi>Adam</hi>'s Poſterity; nor bound to frame the nature of Mankind anew, or to raiſe up a purer breed from the firſt cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted ſtock.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>The Off-ſpring of</hi> Adam <hi>had no Title to that Immortality and other bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, which he forfeited for them.</hi> God-Almighty might, if he pleaſed, have made Mankind at firſt mortal, and ſubject to all the Diſeaſes and Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:42179:133"/>
which are the Preliminaries of Death, and the Puniſhments of Sin; for we had no right to demand from him to be created more happy than the Brutes. Therefore we have no reaſon to repine at God's goodneſs, for not giving us that happineſs after <hi>Adam</hi>'s Sin; which we never had a right to before, but only a poſſibility of having. It is our Duty to thank God, for what we do enjoy, and not to Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur at his goodneſs, and tax his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice for what we do not.</p>
                  <p n="3">3ly, Our firſt Parents might forfeit theſe Bleſſings for us; and God might juſtly deny them to us, by reaſon of their Sin. I do not ſee any great force in that Notion of Divines, which makes the firſt Parents our Repreſentatives, and ſo makes us, to Sin in them <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretative,</hi> as the Schools ſpeak, and therefore to deſerve their Puniſhment: For I cannot apprehend how any one ſhould be my Repreſentative, without being delegated to perſonate me by my own proper and voluntary Act; and I can leſs apprehend why God ſhould puniſh me, for what they did in my name which I never agreed to. But it is very agreeable to the Divine
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:42179:134"/>
Juſtice for God to promiſe ſeveral bleſſings to <hi>Adam,</hi> and his Poſterity, upon his Obedience, which neither he nor his Poſterity ſhould enjoy upon his Diſobedience. And this ſeems very juſt to us, by our often doing the like in our humane affairs, without being taxed with the leaſt injuſtice; as if I leave a Thouſand Pounds a Year to ſuch a Man and his Heirs forever, conditionally that he performs ſuch things as my Will directs; but neither he nor his Poſterity has a right to the Eſtate if that Perſon neglects to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form them. And this vindicates ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently the Divine Juſtice in not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing the ſupernatural Grace to keep Men from Sinning, and in inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Death, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> not conferring im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality; both which were to be conferred upon <hi>Adam,</hi> and his Poſterity, only upon condition of his Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>

Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther does it imply any abſurdity that the Earth ſhould be curſed, for the Sin of Man; for this is conſonant to the general Opinion of Mankind in things of the like nature.

But I pray,<note place="margin">Nor the Curſe of the Serpent.</note> what injuſtice was it to the Serpent, to have his Form ſomething altered from what it was before? I am confident he was not able to diſtinguiſh whether it was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, or no; for that would imply an intelligent nature, to have contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plated his former ſtate, and to have compared it with his latter, which it was impoſſible for the Serpent to have done. But to receive a new ſhape, which he did not know whether it was better or worſe, without any ſenſible pain, or alteration to him, and this too done by an Almighty Power, to whom he ow'd his whole being, and could claim no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at his hands: this is ſo far from
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:42179:137"/>
being Injuſtice, that it is Bounty ſtill. Beſides, Man being Lord of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, had a natural right over the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent; and this change being deſign'd by God for Man's good and Inſtruction, there was no more injuſtice in chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Form of the Serpent for his ſake, than in ſuffering other Creatures to be ſlain for his food. Nor laſtly muſt we ſuppoſe, that God Almighty was any ways offended at the Serpent, becauſe the Devil had poſſeſſed his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans; but the reaſon he worked this change in his Body was, becauſe it ſhould remain as a Monument of the Unhappy Fall, of God's Averſation to Sin, and to deter men from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of that, which brought ſuch Vengeance with it. This was no <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi> puniſhment of the Serpent, but only an <hi>Inſtructive Emblem</hi> to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; ſuch as our Saviour's curſing of the Fig-Tree, not to puniſh the Wood, but to read the Diſciples an Emble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical Lecture, what they were to expect, if they did not bring forth Fruits meet for Repentance. Neither is it diſagreeable to the reaſon of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, to have a proper puniſhment in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>flicted upon the Serpent for being the
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:42179:137"/>
Inſtrument of this unhappy Miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage; any more than it is, when we deſtroy Knives, and Swords, and Beaſts, that have been Inſtrumental in any Man's murder. As for the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Reptility of the Serpent, it is plain from this Hiſtory it is falſe; and we ſuppoſe the change to be from ſuch a bright winged <hi>Saraph,</hi> as was before mentioned, to a mean creeping Snake.</p>

does ſignify the ſudden com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of any thing to a Man's knowledge, by any way whatſoever. Thus God is ſaid to <hi>open the eyes of Balaam,</hi> when the Angel repreſented himſelf in a bodily ſhape to him, <hi>Num.</hi> 22.31.

                  <p>There is, Sir, another very great Difficulty in this Hiſtory, and that is in the relation of their Cloathing, after they were diſcovered to be naked. Now the Text tells us, that they ſew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together Fig-leaves, and therewith made themſelves Aprons.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>O.R.</hi> p. 44.</note> From whence forſooth we may deduce the Original of the Taylors Trade. But then the miſchief is, what they ſhall do for Thread and Needles; for ſpinning was not as yet found out, and working in Iron was an Invention of much later date. So again <hi>v.</hi> 21. when God takes
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:42179:139"/>
the Tayloring work into his own hands, or at leaſt an Angel by his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, <hi>And unto</hi> Adam <hi>and alſo to his Wife did the Lord God make Coats of skins and clothed them.</hi> This Angel then muſt kill, and flea the Animals, and ſtrip off their skins to keep <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> warm; now methinks this ſmells more of the Butcher, or the Hang-Man than the Angel. Beſides theſe Leathern Coats would be purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the Deſtruction of at leaſt one whole ſpecies; for if either Male or Female of any kind had been deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, at the firſt Creation, as this was, there muſt a ſpecies be loſt for ever, for it is not believed, that there were more than two of each kind created, and one alone without another for its Conſort, could never have produced any Off-ſpring.</p>

                     <note place="margin">No abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity in the Relation of the Fig-leaves and the Skins.</note>Here are in this Objection, <hi>Philologus,</hi> ſeveral ſuppoſitions which are all very wild, and if they are denied the Argument falls to the ground. For 1ſt, You ſuppoſe that they ſewed the Fig-leaves together as Taylors do their Cloth, with Needle and Thread, which is more than the Scripture does imply. For the Original word <hi>Tapar</hi> ſignifies
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:42179:139"/>
no more than to <hi>put together, to apply, to fit.</hi> As 'tis uſed, <hi>Job</hi> 16.15. <hi>applied Sackcloth to his Skin.</hi> And the Women in <hi>Ezechiel</hi> are reproved for wearing <hi>Pillows under their Arm-pits, Ez.</hi> 13.18. where we cannot ſuppoſe that <hi>Job</hi> ſow'd the Sack-cloth to his Skin, or that thoſe delicate Women tacked their Pillows to their fleſh, with Needle and Thread. And the word <hi>gneleh,</hi> which we render <hi>leaves,</hi> ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies alſo Branches of Trees, ſuch as were to make <hi>Booths,</hi> or <hi>Bowers, Neh.</hi> 8.15. So that <hi>to adapt, or fit Branches,</hi> which we render <hi>few leaves together;</hi> is only to twiſt or plat the flexible branches of the Fig-Tree round about their waſts, in the manner of a Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Crown; ſo that when the Broad leaves of that Tree hung down, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented the faſhion of a pair of Green Breeches.</p>
                  <p n="2">2ly. You ſuppoſe, that God, or ſome Angel muſt make them their Coats of Skin; which I think is by no means neceſſary. For it is a known obſervation in the Hebrew Tongue, that it is uſed to attribute many things to God, which are not done by his immediate act, but ſometimes by his direction and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:42179:140"/>
by the permiſſion of his ordinary Providence. So here the Coats are ſaid to be made by God, whereas 'tis probable they only received inſtruction how to make them; or only perhaps, becauſe they were the gift of God, as all other Bleſſings; as God is ſaid to give a Man Health, or Wealth, or Strength. 3ly, You ſuppoſe that God could not provide for them theſe Coats, without deſtroying a whole Species, which is a very bold Aſſertion. For it is not certain, what number of Animals of a ſort were created, and therefore the ſuppoſition is weak. Neither is it known how long after the Creation theſe Coats were made; in all proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility it was not till the Winter follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and by that time Hares, Conies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> had time ſufficient to multiply conſiderably.</p>

                  <p>But next, for the cloſe of all this fine Relation, there is a ſtory, which out-does all the Hiſtories of Inchanted Iſlands and Caſtles, that ever were ſeen; and that is the ſtory of the Angels with their flaming Sword, <hi>which turned every way to keep the way of the Tree of Life.</hi> That is a guard of Cherubims are placed at the Entrance
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:42179:140"/>

To the Flood I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, if not longer. So that you here ſuppoſe the Angels, to have been for above 1500 years employ'd in keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Garden. <hi>Sic vacat exiguis rebus adeſſe Deis?</hi> How much eaſier would it have been, to have turned a River round the Garden, which would as effectually have kept <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> out, who knew nothing of Navigation, as all this Brigade of Cherubims.</p>

                     <hi>Puppet-Opera</hi> of the Creation of the World, which I have ſome remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of, ever ſince I was a Boy. For this great too handed flaming Sword ſmells more of the <hi>Booth</hi> than the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. For that which is commonly rendred <hi>Flaming Sword,</hi> is only in the Original the <hi>Flame of Cutting,</hi> or <hi>Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi> or a <hi>dividing Flame;</hi> for though the ſame word does ſignify Sword, it does alſo ſignify Diviſion. And the Writers of the New Teſtament do tranſlate the ſame word both ways. For, whereas St. <hi>Matthew</hi> ſays, our Saviour is come to ſend <hi>a Sword.</hi> Matt. 10.34. St. <hi>Luke</hi> ſays, he is come to ſend <hi>Diviſion,</hi> Luk. 12.51. So that this <hi>dividing Flame,</hi> or <hi>fiery Diviſion,</hi> is but anſwerable to the <hi>Wall of Fire</hi> ſpoken of by the Prophet <hi>Zechary,</hi> C. 2. 5. which the Lord promiſed to make about <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> It was the Accenſion of ſome inflammable matter, round about the Garden, which excluded all comers to it, till ſuch time as the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the place was defaced. Now this opinion muſt be more probable to them, who place Paradiſe in the Eaſtern parts of the World, eſpecially about <hi>Babylon,</hi> where there is ſuch an
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:42179:141"/>
abundance of <hi>Naphtha</hi> and <hi>Bitumen,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Relations of <hi>Pliny, Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch, Strabo,</hi> and <hi>Curtius;</hi> and where there are fields, which even yet at ſometimes of the year, ſeem all on fire. But then you will be apt to ſay, what have theſe Cherubims or Angels to do with this <hi>Fiery Wall?</hi> I anſwer, it is the cuſtom of the Hebrews to expreſs all the extraordinary works of God by Angels, as to call a Plague, Famine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> a deſtroying Angel; nay farther, they being averſe from the Philoſophy of Mechanick and Material Principles uſed to explain the common <hi>Phaenomenae</hi> of nature by Vital, Pneumatick, or which is the ſame, Angelick Principles. So the Pſalmiſt explains the Motions of Winds, and the Burning of Fire, to be performed by the miniſtry and energy of Angels. <hi>Who maketh his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels Spirits</hi> or Winds, <hi>and his Miniſters</hi> a flaming fire, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.4.

Now I ſuppoſe the Hieroglyphick to be this, <hi>A Serpent with a Woman de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering an Apple to a Man.</hi> Which does moſt excellently ſet forth ſuch a lapſe of the Soul; for I ſuppoſe the Soul, when ever it did fall, fell by immerſing it ſelf in ſenſual pleaſures; and probably was incited to it, by the Inſinuation of malicious <hi>Daemons.</hi> Now by the <hi>Woman</hi> and the <hi>Apple</hi> are fitly repreſented all kind of ſenſual pleaſures, Wine, Venery, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the <hi>Serpent</hi> is the crafty <hi>Daemon</hi> which did entice the Soul, and the <hi>Man</hi> the Soul ſo enticed.

For 1ſt,<note place="margin">Such a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy all Hiſtory.</note> This whole Book is Hiſtorical, and this Relation of the Fall is deliver'd in the ſame narratory way as the reſt of the Book of <hi>Geneſis</hi> is.

it muſt I ſay <hi>primâ facie</hi> appear to be <hi>Fable,</hi> or <hi>Parable;</hi> or otherwiſe it would be a Lye, a Legend, or a Romance. So when <hi>Aeſop</hi> tells us the Story of the <hi>Dunghill-Cock,</hi> and our Saviour that of <hi>Dives</hi> and <hi>Lazarus,</hi> they do it in ſuch a way as they cannot be underſtood in a literal ſenſe. But when <hi>Thucydides</hi> relates the Plague of <hi>Athens,</hi> or <hi>Livy</hi> the Battle at <hi>Cannae,</hi> a Man would be mad that ſhould go to Allegorize thoſe paſſages.

<pb n="253" facs="tcp:42179:144"/>
ſame reaſon to write Hieroglyphically or Allegorically, as other Writers might have: For to begin with the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> we know that their Prieſts, who were the great Maſters of their Hieroglyphicks, which were called <hi>Hieroglyphicks ſacred ſculptures</hi> from them; now it was their buſineſs to amuſe the People with theſe dark rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles, to wrap up common and ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Truths in this myſtick dreſs, that the People might the more admire them; which otherwiſe they would have deſpiſed, had they been delivered in the uſual way, and ſo the Prieſts have loſt a great part of their venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But juſt on the contrary, <hi>Moſes</hi> endeavoured to reveal all his Doctrines to the People, he ordered his Books to be read in the Ears of all the People, and commanded Parents to teach them to their Children; ſo that 'tis plain he did not deſign, by Myſtical ſenſes, to keep them from the commonalty, but by all imaginable plainneſs to ſuit them to their Capacities.<note place="margin">Had no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign like the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers to ſerve by an Allegory.</note> Again it was the deſign of the Heathen Philoſophers, who affected Allegories moſt, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part their Notions only to their own Scholars, who were let into the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:42179:145"/>
of that Philoſophical Cant; by which means they excluded the vulgar from underſtanding their Tenets, and kept their learning within the bounds of their own School. But <hi>Moſes</hi> had no ſuch deſign, he was not afraid of any other Philoſophers ſetting up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, and running away with his Notions, he had not a School but a whole Nation to inſtruct, for the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part conſiſting of unlearned and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant People; and therefore he can never be ſuppoſed to make uſe of ſuch myſtical Doctrines, which were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to be underſtood by the illite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Jews.<note place="margin">Nor the ſame deſign with the Allegorical Fathers.</note> And laſtly, for the <hi>Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorizing Fathers,</hi> they cannot be brought in to countenance this opinion; for tho' they Allegorize many Hiſtorical parts of the Bible, yet they leave the literal ſenſe entire ſtill; they allow the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of fact was true, but they will have this matter of fact to have another Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legorical meaning, and to be a Type of ſomething elſe.

Some of them made this Inclinableneſs to Sin, and all the Evil, which is found in the World, to come from an Infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-Evil Principle; a ſort of Anti-God eternally co-exiſting with the good one; which was not only the Opinion of the <hi>Perſian Magi</hi> and the <hi>Manichees,</hi> but as <hi>Plutarch</hi> ſays, was <hi>the Opinion of the moſt and wiſeſt of the Philoſophers.</hi> Now this is ſuch a fooliſh account of Sin, that no one will preſume to compare the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaical</hi> account with it: For to aſſert a God or Principle infinitely Evil, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction in terms: For as all the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes of one God are good, ſo the other muſt be Evil, or juſt contrary or privative to the firſt.<note place="margin">The Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages of the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers in this.</note> As one is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely <hi>juſt</hi> and <hi>merciful,</hi> ſo the other muſt be infinitely <hi>unrighteous</hi> and <hi>cruel;</hi> as the one is infinite in <hi>Power,</hi> ſo the other muſt be infinite in <hi>no Power,</hi> that is, muſt have no power at all; as the one is <hi>Eternal</hi> and <hi>Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary</hi> in his being, the other muſt be infinite in <hi>non-exiſtence,</hi> and be <hi>impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

to be.</hi> All which includes a Troop of Contradictions and Abſurdities.</p>
                  <p>Another ſet of Philoſophers imputed this Obliquity of the Soul to its mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with matter. But it is unintelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, how a meer mixture with matter, which is neither good nor evil, ſhould make a thing originally good to be bad. If they ſay matter was Evil in it ſelf originally; they then make God, which was the Author of matter, to be the Author of the Evil in it, which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious to the Divine Holineſs. If they ſay Matter is Eternal, as <hi>Plutarch</hi> and ſome others of them do, and withal Evil in it ſelf; this is to make ſuch another Eternal Evil Principle, which includes the Abſurdities likewiſe of the <hi>Manichean</hi> Principle.</p>
                  <p>A third ſort attributed this Depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to a pre-exiſtent ſtate of ſinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and that the Inclinableneſs to Sin in this World was but an ill habit of the Soul contracted in another, by a voluntary deviation from God.

<pb n="258" facs="tcp:42179:147"/>
generally took up with, after they had been beat off from their other accounts by the Arguments of the Chriſtians.

But I pray, what evidence had thoſe Philoſophers of ſuch a pre-exiſtent State? They ought ſolid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to have proved firſt the State, in which this pretended Lapſe happened, before they aſſerted the Lapſe it ſelf; which after all is but their pure Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Beſides, theſe Philoſophers ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally make this Immerſion into groſs matter, to be the puniſhment of the Soul for her Offences in her pre exiſting State; but then ſuch an Immerſion is not a proper way of Puniſhment of the Soul, and ſeems inconſiſtent with the Wiſdom and Juſtice of God. For all Puniſhments inflicted by God, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in probatory ſtates, are in order to amendment; now the Soul not having Reminiſcence of her former ſtate, it is impoſſible for her to amend the Errours
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:42179:147"/>
of that ſtate, ſhe cannot remember. Theſe are the accounts which the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers give of the <hi>Depravation of the Soul;</hi> which are all very lame and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfactory in themſelves, as they are aſſerted without any proof. But on the contrary, what can be more natural and eaſy, than to account for this, by deducing Mankind from one common ſtock, which had deviated from its Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Rectitude? That the Soul was ſtrangely degenerated from its Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſtamp, was a thing which all wiſe Men were ſenſible of, but how this came to paſs, the Heathens to whom God had not vouchſafed his Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, was a thing they could only gueſs and blunder at in the dark. Hence <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> compares the ſtate of the Soul in the Body, to the <hi>Etruſcan</hi> Robbers joining dead Bodies to living ones.

                     </note> for the Excellency of the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Fall is, becauſe it gives a <hi>Rationale</hi> of the <hi>Pudor circa res venereas,</hi> which is a Thing which all the reaſon of Mankind was never able to do: For how ſtrange is it to conſider, what an innate baſhfulneſs there is implanted in all Mankind as to theſe things, and they are looked upon Monſters in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that can deveſt themſelves of it; and yet to conſider, how little natural reaſon is to be given for ſuch a ſhame? Nay I defy the whole Wit of Mankind, to give any one tolerably ſatisfactory. For there is no reaſon in the World, why Mankind ſhould not uſe publick commixtures in a lawful way as well as eat and drink in publick; or why he ſhould be aſhamed of one more than the other: For nothing in nature is really ſhameful but Vice. And upon this account the <hi>Cynick</hi> Philoſophers reaſoned themſelves into ſuch Beaſts as to throw off all ſhame of this nature,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:42179:149"/>
and pretended it was only a vulgar Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour. But notwithſtanding this, the generality of men find a mighty im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe of unaccountable ſhame over-ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them in ſuch matters, and the moſt impudent are forced to ſtruggle long with it, before they can conquer it; and which no one can give a natural reaſon for, but muſt be beholding to the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Relation to account for. And from hence all the difficulty is cleared up; we from hence learn what Irregularities we fall into by the defect of that Original Grace forfeited by the firſt Parents, and from the predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy of our Animal Nature over our Spiritual; and that this ſhame is not only a Note of our own Turpitude, but a perpetual Mark and Brand of our ſhameful Origin from ſuch a dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate ſtock.</p>

Ariſtotle</hi> in his Book of Animals, long ago obſerved, that Woman, of all Creatures in the World, was moſt vexed and tormented in bringing forth. Now what an unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable thing is it, that Woman, which is the principal Female of the
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:42179:149"/>
whole Creation, ſhould be dealt withal more unkindly by God, than the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Creature upon Earth? I defy the wiſeſt Philoſopher upon Earth, to give a reaſon, why other Females ſhould bring forth with ſo much eaſe, and why God ſhould inflict ſuch intolerable pain upon Woman alone. To be ſure God Almighty did not allot this out of humour and Caprice, but he had a very good reaſon for it; now never any to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable reaſon was aſſigned beſides that, which <hi>Moſes</hi> has given in his Relation of the Fall, and this appears very ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory and rational, and therefore is a very good Argument for the Truth and Excellency of this Hiſtory.</p>
                  <p n="4">4.

And indeed from natural Light there is no reaſon to be given for it. For indeed it is very ſurpriſing to conſider, what ungrateful returns oftentimes the ſtubborn ground yields to the care of the Husbandman, how prolifick it is of its own accord of noxious and uſeleſs Herbs, and how ſparingly it produces
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:42179:150"/>
thoſe we want; what a great part of the World is uninhabitable De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts and Barren Heaths, that are uncapable of any Tillage, and bring forth hardly any thing profitable to Mankind. Now this, which has puz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zled the Wit of all the Heathen World, is fairly accounted for in <hi>Moſes</hi> his Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory; when he relates this as a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the diſobedience of our firſt Parents. I could yet urge farther, in behalf of this Hiſtory of the Fall, the ſlowneſs of the Education of Children, and their natural Imbecillity above all other Creatures, the ſubjection of the Woman to the Man, our Antipathy to Viperous Animals, if you can have patience to hear them; and which can never be accounted for but by the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaick</hi> Hiſtory.</p>

                  <p>You need not beſpeak my Patience, Sir, at any time for your Diſcourſe; but I think by the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments you have brought upon this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject you have proved it ſtrenuouſly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough. And the Night draws on, and therefore I muſt haſten away. My hearty thanks, Sir, for the pains you have taken towards converting a poor Infidel; and at your leiſure I will take another opportunity to be further Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techized.</p>
